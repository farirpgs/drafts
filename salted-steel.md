**Salted Steel**

A penitent walks into the Derweald to keep their vows. The forest takes them back, piece by piece.

## The Derweald

The Derweald is a living rot, ancient and hungry. Its roots drink names, memories, and blood. What dies in its shadow rises again, bark-bound and driven by the forest's will.

Some hunters survive their claiming and keep their will. They cut root scars into their forearms with blessed steel and pack the wounds with salt until they rise into knotted patterns. These scars are proof that both body and soul are battlegrounds.

The Order of the Duskwatch accepts these penitent hunters as Wardens and sends them back into the thorns to complete their Vows.

## What Is Needed

One standard deck of cards shared among the table, paper, and pencil. One Game Master (or GM) and one to four players.

Card values follow this scale: Aces count as 1, numbered cards use their normal value, and face cards are valued at 11 for Jacks, 12 for Queens, and 13 for Kings.

After a card is used, it is put in a discard pile. When the deck runs empty and cards are needed, the Game Master shuffles the discard pile to form a new deck.

## Making a Character

Players take a piece of paper (this will act as their character sheet) and then go through the following steps:

### 1. Name

Each player writes their own name on their character sheet.

### 2. Character Name

The player chooses a name for their character.

### 3. Abilities

Ability scores measure a character's core capabilities. Each Ability ranges from 0 to 6 and determines how many cards the player draws during Tests. During character creation, players distributes 6 points among the four Abilities, with no single Ability exceeding 3:

- **Iron**: Strength and endurance. Governs brute force, resilience, heavy blows, and physical labor.
- **Edge**: Agility and precision. Governs quick reflexes, acrobatics, stealth, and aimed strikes.
- **Wits**: Cunning and perception. Governs awareness, deduction, traps, and tactical thinking.
- **Heart**: Willpower and connection. Governs resolve, persuasion, animal handling, and resisting corruption.

### 4. Details

Details record important facts about a character or track the gear they carry. There is no limit to how many Details a character can have. A character can carry as much gear as makes sense in the fiction, but the Game Master has the final say. Relevant Details can help or hinder a character when tackling challenging tasks or when trying to avoid a direct threat.

During character creation, the player writes one Detail from each category on their character sheet:

- **Weapon**: 1. Sword, 2. Axe, 3. Spear, 4. Bow, 5. Flail, 6. Dagger, 7. Mace, 8. Greatsword, 9. Crossbow, 10. Halberd, Jack. Warhammer, Queen. Quarterstaff, King. Whip
- **Armor**: 1–3. Cloak or Clothes, 4–6. Leather, 7–9. Chain, 10–11. Plate, 12–13. Shield
- **Tools**: 1. Lantern, 2. Rope, 3. Crowbar, 4. Lockpicks, 5. Chain, 6. Grapnel, 7. Torch, 8. Vials, 9. Compass, 10. Spikes, Jack. Mirror, Queen. Chalk, King. Trap Kit
- **Skill**: 1. Herbalist, 2. Blademaster, 3. Marksman, 4. Ritualist, 5. Beast Tamer, 6. Duelist, 7. Scout, 8. Magehunter, 9. Pathfinder, 10. Skirmisher, Jack. Shadowblade, Queen. Deathseeker, King. Spellbreaker

### 5. Gift

A Gift is power stolen from the Derweald and held by rite and restraint. Each character has one, recorded as a Detail. Each time a character invokes their Gift, the Pull of corruption grows stronger. During character creation, players choose one gift:

- **Stonehide**: Flesh hardens like stone, making it extremely hard to be wounded.
- **Bonegrind**: Channel brutal force, gaining unnatural strength.
- **Vinewright**: Control the roots and thorns to entangle, snare, pierce, or drag.
- **Wildtongue**: Command the warped creatures of the forest to do your bidding.
- **Soulgrip**: Seize hold of another's emotions and bend them to your will.

### 6. Harm and Pull

Harm tracks physical or mental trauma. When all five boxes are filled, the character falls unconscious, is critically wounded, or is slain. During character creation, players draw five empty Harm boxes on their character sheet.

Pull measures how tightly the Derweald grips the character's soul. At Pull 6, the forest claims them for good. During character creation, players sets their character's Pull to 1.

## Tests

When a character attempts something challenging, risky, or difficult, or when they try to avoid a direct threat, the Game Master calls for a Test. First, the Game Master frames what's at stake. What happens on failure, what consequences are on the table. Then the Game Master sets a Difficulty Rating (DR).

### Difficulty Rating

The DR represents how hard something is to accomplish. The Game Master chooses based on the obstacle:

- **Routine (DR 3)**: Simple, but has a chance of failure.
- **Simple (DR 5)**: Manageable with some skill or luck.
- **Standard (DR 7)**: A meaningful trial.
- **Difficult (DR 9)**: Only the capable or fortunate prevail.
- **Extreme (DR 11)**: At the edge of mortal limits.

### Making the Test

The Game Master determines which Ability applies. The player draws cards equal to the relevant Ability's value. If the Ability is 0, the player draws 2 cards and discards the highest. Relevant Details (the right or wrong item, the use of a Gift, etc.) may increase or reduce the DR.

The player reveals all drawn cards and counts how many meet or exceed the DR:

- **2+ cards meet or exceed the DR**: Critical success. The character succeeds decisively: the outcome is better than expected, faster, cleaner, or carries an additional advantage.
- **1 card meets or exceeds the DR**: Success. The character accomplishes what they set out to do.
- **0 cards meet or exceed the DR**: Failure. The character fails or faces the stated consequences.

### Extended Tests

Some tasks require sustained effort: combat, pursuits, fortifications, rituals, or journeys through hostile ground. The Game Master sets a number of successes needed: 3 for short ordeals, 5 for demanding ones, 7 or more for grueling trials. Failures carry consequences but don't reset progress. Each card that meets or exceeds the DR counts as one success toward the goal.

### Combat

There is no turn order or rounds in combat. The fiction dictates who acts and what is possible. A blade cannot harm what it cannot reach. An armored creature will not fall to desperate slashing. The Game Master describes what the threat does, what it is capable of, and what openings exist. Players describe how their characters respond.

When a character strikes at an enemy, puts themselves in harm's way, or when a threat is directly on them, they make a Test. The Game Master sets the DR based on the threat.

- **Critical success**: The character strikes true and avoids retaliation.
- **Success**: The character lands their strike but is harmed as a result.
- **Failure**: The character misses, and is harmed as a result.

Minor threats fall in one or two decisive blows. Dangerous foes are Extended Tests: each success is ground gained, a wound opened, an advantage seized. The fight ends when the successes are met or the characters are broken.

When the enemy acts unopposed, there is no Test. The Game Master describes what happens. Characters can spend their action to defend, dodge, or retreat instead of attacking.

## Harm

Harm tracks how much physical or mental trauma a character can take before things become critical or mortal. A character starts with five empty Harm boxes.

When a character is harmed, the Game Master draws cards based on the threat (1 card for standard threats, 2 for serious threats, and 3 for dire threats). Each black card (Spades or Clubs) fills one Harm box. Red cards (Hearts or Diamonds) are near-misses, but don't fill boxes.

When all five boxes are filled, the character falls unconscious, is critically wounded, or is slain. The Game Master and player determine which fits the moment.

### Rest and Recovery

Recovery requires time and safety.

- **Short Rest** (minutes of catching breath): The player draws 1 card.
- **Long Rest** (hours of shelter and bandages): The player draws 2 cards.
- **Full Rest** (days in true sanctuary): The player draws 3 cards.

Each red card clears 1 Harm box.

## Pull

A character's Pull level represents the Derweald's hold over their corrupted soul, a creeping tether that tightens with every dark bargain. It begins at 1 and climbs toward 6. When Pull reaches 6, the forest claims the character forever: they are removed from play, fall under the Game Master's control, and become a threat to those they once called allies.

### Invoking a Gift

A character can invoke their Gift to solve problems or overcome obstacles. Using a Gift may cancel the need for a Test entirely, or significantly reduce the DR of a Test. Anytime a character invokes their Gift, they must make a Pull Check.

**Pull Check**: The player draws 1 card and compares its value to their current Pull level. If the card's value is less than or equal to their Pull level, it increases by 1.

### Purification

A character can resist the forest's claim in moments of sanctity. This requires a place of holiness: a shrine, an altar, a sacred grove, or a sanctuary blessed by the Church. The character confesses sins at a relic, holds a vigil while fasting, prays over running water, or pours blood into salt.

After the rite, the player draws 3 cards. For each drawn card that is red, the character's Pull level is reduced by 1.

## Getting Started

### The Opening Scene

Each player introduces their character: their name, what they look like, and one memory from before the claiming. Then the Game Master frames the opening: the group is already mid-mission, deep in the thorns, with their Vow half-complete and trouble closing in.

### Group Vow

A Vow is a mission, the purpose that keeps the Order's mercy pointed forward. When the group completes a Vow, each character fully clears their Pull and the group takes on a new Vow.

To generate a Vow, draw one card from each table and combine the results. Or choose elements that speak to you.
