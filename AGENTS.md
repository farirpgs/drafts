# Writing Style Rules

- Use the Oxford comma in all lists.
- Avoid contractions. Write is not, do not, and cannot instead of isn't, don't, and can't.
- Never use em dashes. Use regular dashes, commas, or colons instead.
- Avoid the "X, not Y" or "X as Y, not Z" sentence structure. State what something is directly instead of contrasting it.
- Follow proper heading hierarchy. Never skip levels: h1 > h2 > h3 > h4. Each heading level must be nested under the previous level.

# PDF Generation

- PDFs can be generated from markdown files using the npm script defined in package.json. Run `npm run build` to regenerate all PDFs.
