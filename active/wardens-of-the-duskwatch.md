Writing Guidelines

- Use Pascal Case for all mechanical terms: Great Success, Bare Success, Draw, Vitae, Radiance, Complication, and so on.
- When referencing an Action in text, use backticks like `Action Name`.
- Reserve the term Draw for the core resolution mechanic only. Use reveal when showing cards for tables, oracles, or random procedures.
- Write in third person only. Use the character, the player, or themselves. Never use you, your, or yourself.
- Use the Oxford comma in all lists.
- Avoid contractions. Write is not, do not, and cannot instead of isn't, don't, and can't.
- Never use em dashes. Use regular dashes, commas, or colons instead.
- Avoid the "X, not Y" or "X as Y, not Z" sentence structure. State what something is directly instead of contrasting it.
- List card suits in this order: Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, Hearts.
- Phrase Action outcomes using present participles (-ing verbs) directly after the result. Put mechanical effects first, then narrative flavor.

Action Format:

1. Heading: Use level 4 heading (####) with the Action name.
2. Trigger: Start with "When a character [does something], Draw+[Score]." Use "Draw+appropriate Score" if multiple Scores apply.
3. Score Options (if appropriate Score): Use a bullet list starting with "If the character acts..." followed by "- With [method]: Draw+[Score]." End with "- If nothing else applies: Draw+Fortune."
4. Situational Modifiers: Use a blockquote (>) with "If [favorable condition], take 1 Advantage. If [unfavorable condition], take 1 Disadvantage."
5. Resolution Intro: Add "Then, resolve the Action as follows:" before the outcomes.
6. Outcomes: Use a bullet list with the following format:
   - Radiant: "When the outcome is Radiant, the character [narrative flavor], [mechanical effect]."
   - Bright: "When the outcome is Bright, the character [narrative flavor], [mechanical effect]."
   - Dire: "When the outcome is Dire, the character [narrative flavor], and there is a Complication."
7. Complication Table (optional): Add "When the outcome is Dire, the player may reveal a card to help determine the nature of the Complication:" followed by a suit-based bullet list in Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, Hearts order.

# Wardens of the Duskwatch

A penitent walks into the Derweald to cleanse their soul before they are lost and judged in the final reckoning.

## The Derweald

The Derweald of Lightwall is a living rot: ancient, patient, and eternally hungry. Its roots burrow through soil and soul alike, drinking names, memories, and blood. What dies beneath its boughs does not rest. The dead rise again as Pallids: bark-bound, hollow-eyed, and mindless, thralls to spirits the Church of the One Light swore it had vanquished centuries ago.

But when the claiming comes swift as the wind, a rare few rise again with their minds intact, cursed with gifts they never asked for and the forest's hooks buried deep in their thoughts. These creatures are power, hunger, and forever. They are called Thornmouths.

The Order of the Duskwatch hunts Thornmouths without mercy and searches for those with resolve enough to fight the pull of the roots through Faith to welcome into their ranks as Wardens. The Order's priests carve root scars into their forearms with consecrated steel and pack the wounds with blessed salt until the flesh rises into knotted patterns. Body and soul both becoming a battleground to help fight the pull and resist this corrupted power from taking over.

Armed with blessed blades, whispered prayers, and salted steel, the Wardens are sent back into the thorns to fulfill cleanse evil, or die trying.

## A Brief History

**Spirits and the Church**

- Spirits have crossed between realms since the first breaths of the world, feeding on the emotions of the living. Some once mistook them for gods. There are no gods.
- The Church of the One Light despised the spirits, calling them abominations. Driven by holy fury, they marched through the veiled gates to purge them from existence.
- The spirits were eradicated, their arcane essence torn apart and scattered like leaves in a storm.

**The Rise of Magic**

- The magical energy that spilled from the spirits seeped into every crack of the world, bleeding into soil, stone, and sky.
- Common folk harvested this power to craft humble charms, while scholars shaped it into incantations capable of bending reality itself.
- Fearing a loss of power, the Church declared the use of magic a divine right reserved for their order alone.
- Those who defied them were branded heretics, tortured, and executed beneath the radiant banners of the One Light.

**The Return of the Spirits**

- Death has no hold on spirits. When the veil tore once more, it did so in the Derweald.
- Thorned vines and slick fungal growths erupted from the soil like a living plague.
- The oily roots consumed kingdoms and souls alike. As the fallen exhaled their final breath, their bodies warped into wooden husks bound by ancient wills.
- The spirits walked the land once more, driving their pallid armies against the last bastions of warmth and light.

**The Church's Desperation**

- So much of the realm was lost to the forest's embrace. Castles, cities, palaces, dungeons, villages all swallowed whole.
- The Church of the One Light claims dominion over the last bastions of humanity, but their power is built on lies. Only the highest clergy know there are no gods, yet they wield faith as a weapon to control the desperate.
- In their desperation to maintain power and fight the Derweald, the Church has become what they claimed to destroy. They weaponize corruption itself, binding cursed souls with salt and steel.
- The Wardens, proof of this hypocrisy. Corrupted souls sent back into the thorns, wielding the forest's gifts to fight the forest's will, all while the Church's priests condemn others for the very same sins.

## Play to Find Out

The setting holds many unanswered questions:

- Why does the Church hate spirits? What happened during the war beyond the veiled gates?
- Where does the Church's power come from if there are no gods?
- What do spirits gain from feeding on emotions? Why do they keep returning?
- Can the Derweald be stopped, or will the corruption consume everything?
- Are the Wardens meant to save humanity, or are they just disposable weapons?
- What drives the forest? What will commands the roots?

## The Last Bastions

The Derweald has consumed much of the land. What remains:

**Kelmora (North)**

- An icy bay where the Barahl Clans once rode dragons as feared raiders. Now they fight for survival under The Iron Rule.
- They battle Ithril the Calamity, whose power turned their wyrms against them.
- The cold spared them from the Derweald's hold. Mostly. The frost is thinning, and the roots are coming.

**The Free Cities (West)**

- Velmoor struggles to feed the cities as the Derweald presses closer. Naranth starves as the sea grows empty. Refugees flee to Eslora, where the grand cathedral of the One Light stands.
- The Shattered Isles loom on the horizon as a warning of what is to come.

**The Mireroads (Heart)**

- Market towns trapped between the Derweald, the wild sea, and the jagged peaks of the Ashen Teeth.
- Old horrors have returned: trolls, goblins, ghouls. Famine and sickness is everywhere.
- The Church's reach is weak here. New beliefs spread that offerings to the spirits is the path to salvation.

## What Is Needed

One standard deck of cards shared among the table, paper, and pencil. The game can be played solo, cooperatively without a Game Master (GM), or with a GM and one to four players.

Card values follow this scale: Aces count as 1, numbered cards use their normal value, and face cards are valued at 11 for Jacks, 12 for Queens, and 13 for Kings.

Place used cards in a discard pile. When the deck runs empty, or whenever revealing a Joker, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

## Safety

This game explores themes of death, corruption, and violence. Before play begins, discuss boundaries and comfort levels with all players. Establish what topics are off-limits or should be handled with care, and respect those limits without question. Any player may pause the game at any time to discuss comfort, adjust content, or step away from a scene. The goal is for everyone to have a meaningful experience without crossing into discomfort.

## Making a Character

Players take a piece of paper (this will act as their character sheet) and then go through the following steps:

### 1. Name

Each player writes their own name on their character sheet.

### 2. Character Name

The player chooses a name for their character.

### 3. Records

Records are used to keep track of important facts about a character: specific items, bonds with non-player characters, pieces of intel, clues, lasting wounds, or other important notes. There is no limit to how many Records a character can have. Relevant Records can help or hinder a character when tackling challenging tasks or when trying to avoid a direct threat.

During character creation, the player reveals a card for each category to determine their starting Records:

**Weapon** (reveal 1):

- 1. Sword
- 2. Axe
- 3. Spear
- 4. Bow
- 5. Flail
- 6. Dagger
- 7. Mace
- 8. Greatsword
- 9. Crossbow
- 10. Halberd
- Jack. Warhammer
- Queen. Quarterstaff
- King. Whip

**Armor** (reveal 1):

- 1–3. Cloak
- 4–6. Leather
- 7–9. Chain
- 10–11. Plate
- 12–13. Shield

**Gear** (reveal 3):

- 1. Lantern
- 2. Rope
- 3. Crowbar
- 4. Lockpicks
- 5. Chain
- 6. Grapnel
- 7. Torch
- 8. Vials
- 9. Compass
- 10. Spikes
- Jack. Mirror
- Queen. Chalk
- King. Trap Kit

**Skill** (reveal 1):

- 1. Herbalist
- 2. Blademaster
- 3. Marksman
- 4. Ritualist
- 5. Beast Tamer
- 6. Duelist
- 7. Scout
- 8. Magehunter
- 9. Pathfinder
- 10. Skirmisher
- Jack. Shadowblade
- Queen. Deathseeker
- King. Spellbreaker

> Significant amounts of coin, artifacts, valuable treasures, or debts should also be tracked as Records when acquired during play.

### 4. Scores

Scores measure a character's capabilities and resources.

**Core Scores** range from 0 to 5. During character creation, players distribute 8 points among the four Core Scores, with no single Score exceeding 3:

- **Strength**: Physical power. Governs brute force, heavy blows, and feats of might.
- **Dexterity**: Agility and precision. Governs quick reflexes, acrobatics, stealth, and ranged attacks.
- **Willpower**: Mental fortitude and presence. Governs resolve, perception, persuasion, and resisting corruption.
- **Constitution**: Endurance and toughness. Governs resilience, stamina, and resistance to physical hardship.

**Reserve Scores** fluctuate during play. All start at 5 during character creation, except Fortune which starts at 3:

- **Vitae (5)**: Physical and mental health.
- **Faith (5)**: Inner light and resistance to corruption.
- **Supply (5)**: Provisions, ammunition, expendable gear, and purchasing power for everyday needs.
- **Fortune (3)**: Luck and fate's favor.

### 5. Gift

A Gift is power stolen from the Derweald and held by rite and restraint. Each character has one, added as a Record. During character creation, players choose one gift:

- **Stonehide**: Flesh hardens like stone, making it extremely hard to be wounded.
- **Bonegrind**: Channel brutal force, gaining unnatural strength.
- **Vinewright**: Control the roots and thorns to entangle, snare, pierce, or drag.
- **Wildtongue**: Command the warped creatures of the forest to do your bidding.
- **Soulgrip**: Seize hold of another's emotions and bend them to your will.

## Rules

### The Oracle

The Oracle is used to answer questions when the fiction is uncertain. It can be consulted freely during play to resolve unknowns, or triggered by specific Actions. To consult the Oracle, frame a yes-or-no question and reveal cards based on likelihood:

| Likelihood     | Cards |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Almost Certain | 4     |
| Likely         | 3     |
| 50/50          | 2     |
| Unlikely       | 1     |

- When there are more red cards (Diamonds or Hearts) than black, the answer is **Yes**.
- When there are more black cards (Clubs or Spades) than red, the answer is **No**.
- When there is a tie, the answer is **Yes, but...** the results are extreme or there is an unexpected twist.

### Oracle Sparks

If after consulting the Oracle a player is still uncertain how things should unfold or how the result should be interpreted, the player reveals 2 cards from the deck. Match the first card to the Theme Spark table and the second to the Impulse Spark table to generate a creative prompt.

**Theme Spark** (reveal first card)

### The Draw

All of the game's following mechanics are called Actions: things that trigger when characters do certain things in the fiction. When an Action is triggered, it will outline that the player must make a Draw, usually in the form of "When this happens, Draw+Score." Follow the steps below to resolve the Action's outcome.

#### Making a Draw

The player draws 1 Action card and adds the relevant Score to the card's numeral value. Then, 2 Challenge cards are drawn. The player compares their Action total against each Challenge card.

If the player's Action total is higher than both Challenge cards, the outcome is **Radiant**. When an Action revolves around determining the outcome of a character's efforts, they succeed with greater effect. When an Action revolves around determining something about the world, the character finds themselves in a great position.

If the player's Action total is higher than one Challenge card, the outcome is **Bright**. When an Action revolves around determining the outcome of a character's efforts, they succeed at what they were trying to do. When an Action revolves around determining something about the world, the character finds themselves in a good position.

If the player's Action total is higher than neither Challenge card, the outcome is **Dire**. When an Action revolves around determining the outcome of a character's efforts, they fail and there is a Complication. When an Action revolves around determining something about the world, the character finds themselves in a bad position.

Whenever an Action triggers a Complication, it shall always provide prompts to help determine its nature.

#### Using Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage comes from favorable conditions, preparation, relevant Records, or invoking a Gift. For each level of Advantage, add 1 to the Action total.

Disadvantage comes from adverse conditions, wounds, missing gear, or hostile circumstances. For each level of Disadvantage, subtract 1 from the Action total.

Particularly impactful Advantages or Disadvantages may be worth more than 1 point to the Action total.

#### Using Fortune

Fortune can be spent or earned by pushing outcomes beyond what fate intended.

- **Push Through**: When the outcome is Dire, the player may push it to Bright instead, losing 1 Fortune in the process.
- **Accept Hardship**: When the outcome is Radiant, the player may choose to accept a Bright outcome instead, restoring 1 Fortune in the process.

Fortune cannot go lower than 0 or higher than 5. A player cannot spend Fortune they do not have.

### Actions

#### Overcome a Challenge

When a character faces a challenge, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character acts...

- With brute force, aggression, or raw power: Draw+Strength.
- With speed, agility, precision, or stealth: Draw+Dexterity.
- With cunning, perception, persuasion, or mental fortitude: Draw+Willpower.
- With endurance, resilience, or toughness: Draw+Constitution.
- If nothing else applies: Draw+Fortune.

> If the character is well-prepared or conditions are favorable, take 1 Advantage. If the character is hindered or conditions are hostile, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **When the outcome is Radiant**: The character greatly succeeds.
- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character succeeds.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The character fails, and there is a Complication.

When the outcome is Dire, the player may reveal a card to help determine the nature of the Complication:

- **♣ Clubs**: Time. The character loses precious time or an opportunity slips away.
- **♠ Spades**: Danger. The character suffers harm or attracts a threat.
- **♦ Diamonds**: Loss. The character loses Supply or valuable gear is damaged.
- **♥ Hearts**: Trust. A relationship is strained or an ally is put at risk.

#### Avoid a Consequence

When a character tries to avoid a consequence from a hazard, hostile opposition, or dangerous environment, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character reacts...

- With brute force, blocking, or standing firm: Draw+Strength.
- With speed, dodging, or quick reflexes: Draw+Dexterity.
- With focus, willpower, or mental resistance: Draw+Willpower.
- With endurance, resilience, or toughness: Draw+Constitution.
- If nothing else applies: Draw+Fortune.

> If the threat is serious, take 1 Disadvantage. If the threat is dire, take 2 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **When the outcome is Radiant**: The character avoids the consequence and gains an opportunity, taking 1 Advantage for a future Action if applicable.
- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character avoids the consequence.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The character suffers the full consequence. When suffering harm, lose Vitae. When fighting corruption, lose Faith. If nothing else applies, the consequence is rooted in the fiction.

The amount of Vitae or Faith lost depends on the severity of the threat: minor threats deal 1, serious threats deal 2, and dire threats deal 3 or more.

If a character's Vitae ever reaches 0, it immediately triggers the use of the `Resist Death` Action.

#### Secure an Opportunity

When a character prepares for what lies ahead, whether through positioning, investigation, or building trust, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character acts...

- With intimidation, a show of force, or holding ground: Draw+Strength.
- With positioning, searching, sneaking, or observation: Draw+Dexterity.
- With patience, endurance, or sharing hardship: Draw+Constitution.
- With planning, deduction, persuasion, or reading people: Draw+Willpower.
- By paying for information or offering trade: Draw+Supply.
- If nothing else applies: Draw+Fortune.

> If the character has time to prepare, the situation is calm, or the source is cooperative, take 1 Advantage. If the character is rushed, under pressure, or the source is guarded, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **When the outcome is Radiant**: The character secures the opportunity, creating 2 Advantage that can be used on a future Action if applicable. If relevant, add a bond, clue, or piece of intel as a Record.
- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character secureßs the opportunity, creating 1 Advantage that can be used on a future Action if applicable. If relevant, add a bond, clue, or piece of intel as a Record.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The character fails to secure the opportunity, and there is a Complication.

When the outcome is Dire, the player may reveal a card to help determine the nature of the Complication:

- **♣ Clubs**: Time. The opportunity slips away, or an obligation is now owed.
- **♠ Spades**: Danger. The character attracts a threat or reveals something personal.
- **♦ Diamonds**: Loss. The character loses Supply, or a debt must be paid first.
- **♥ Hearts**: Trust. A relationship is strained, or word spreads about the character's methods.

#### Enter Combat

When a character initiates combat or reacts to an ambush, Draw+Dexterity.

> If the character is prepared or has the element of surprise, take 1 Advantage. If the character is caught off guard or outnumbered, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **When the outcome is Radiant**: The character seizes initiative, taking 1 Advantage on their next ACtion.
- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character engages on equal footing.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The character loses initiative, taking 1 Disadvantage on their next Action.

There is no turn order or rounds. This Action establishes who acts first, then the fiction flows back and forth between the characters and their enemies. Players usually act using `Inflict Harm`, `Overcome a Challenge`, or `Secure an Opportunity`. When enemies strike back, it prompts players to react using `Avoid a Consequence`.

#### Inflict Harm

When a character strikes at an enemy or engages a threat in combat, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character attacks...

- With a melee weapon or bare hands: Draw+Strength.
- With a ranged weapon or thrown object: Draw+Dexterity.
- With arcane power or a Gift: Draw+Willpower.

> If the character has the upper hand or the enemy is exposed, take 1 Advantage. If the enemy is armored, fortified, or has the upper hand, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **When the outcome is Radiant**: The character strikes true and gains an opportunity, taking 1 Advantage for their next Action.
- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character lands the strike.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The character misses, and there is a Complication.

When the outcome is Dire, the player may reveal a card to help determine the nature of the Complication:

- **♣ Clubs**: Position. The enemy gains the upper hand or forces the character back.
- **♠ Spades**: Harm. The character suffers harm in retaliation. Lose 1 Vitae.
- **♦ Diamonds**: Loss. A weapon is damaged, dropped, or stuck.
- **♥ Hearts**: Exposure. An ally is put in danger or the character is left vulnerable.

Minor foes fall in one or two strikes. Dangerous foes require multiple successful attacks. The fiction dictates what is possible during combat. A blade or arrow cannot harm what it cannot reach or pierce. An armored creature will not fall to desperate slashing, etc.

#### Invoke Gift

When a character calls upon their Gift to overcome an obstacle or solve a problem, Draw+Willpower.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **When the outcome is Radiant**: The character invokes their Gift, keeping their Faith.
- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character invokes their Gift, losing 1 Faith.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The character invokes their Gift but looses control, losing 2 Faith.

The outcome of invoking a Gift is rooted in the fiction. The character describes how they channel the forest's power, and the effect manifests according to the Gift's nature and the situation at hand.

If a character's Faith ever reaches 0, they must immediately use the `Resist the Forest` Action.

#### Treat Wounds

When a character tends to injuries or wounds, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character acts...

- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character treats the wounds adequately, restoring 1 Vitae.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The character fails to treat the wounds, and there is a Complication.

When the outcome is Dire, the player may reveal a card to help determine the nature of the Complication:

- **♣ Clubs**: Time. The treatment takes far longer than expected.
- **♠ Spades**: Complication. The wound worsens or becomes infected.
- **♦ Diamonds**: Waste. Supplies are consumed without effect. Lose 1 Supply.
- **♥ Hearts**: Strain. The effort takes a toll on the healer. Lose 1 Vitae.

#### Rest

When a character spends 6+ hours resting, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character rests...

- In a safe place or shelter: Draw+Constitution.
- In the wilds or while on the move: Draw+Supply.

> If the area is sheltered or defensible, take 1 Advantage. If finds a true sanctuary, take 2 Advantage. If the area is exposed or deep in corrupted territory, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **When the outcome is Radiant**: The character rests fully, restoring 3 Vitae.
- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character rests adequately, restoring 2 Vitae.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The character rests poorly, restoring only 1 Vitae, and there is a Complication.

When the outcome is Dire, the player may reveal a card to help determine the nature of the Complication:

> When foraging in an area that is fertile or lush, take 1 Advantage. If the area is barren or corrupted, take 1 Disadvantage.
>
> When selling minor valuables found during a Hunt, each item grants 1 Advantage. Exceptional artifacts or treasures cannot be sold through this Action. Their payment becomes a Record instead.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **When the outcome is Radiant**: The character acquires what they need and more, restoring 2 Supply.
- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character acquires enough to get by, restoring 1 Supply.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The character acquires nothing, and there is a Complication.

When the outcome is Dire, the player may reveal a card to help determine the nature of the Complication:

- **♣ Clubs**: Time. The search or negotiation takes far longer than expected.
- **♠ Spades**: Danger. The character attracts predators, thieves, or unwanted attention.
- **♦ Diamonds**: Loss. Gear is damaged, lost, or the price is far higher than expected.
- **♥ Hearts**: Exposure. The character suffers exhaustion or minor harm. Lose 1 Vitae.

#### Purify

When a character seeks to cleanse their soul and resist the forest's claim, Draw+Willpower.

> If the character is at a place of holiness (a shrine, altar, sacred grove, or sanctuary blessed by the Church), take 1 Advantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **When the outcome is Radiant**: The character grows stronger through struggle. Increase one Core Score by 1 (max 5).
- **When the outcome is Bright**: The character learns from the Hunt. Gain a new skill or ability as a Record.
- **When the outcome is Dire**: The forest claims a piece of the character's soul. Decrease maximum Faith by 1 permanently.

## Principles

### Principles for Game Masters

**The Forest Lives**

- The Derweald is ancient, patient, and always hungry.
- Telegraph threats clearly. Let players see danger before it strikes.
- The forest remembers. Let the world react to what the characters do.

**Provide Information**

- Describe freely. Let players ask questions and explore.
- Describe what they see, not what it means. Let players interpret and decide for themselves.
- Do not hide crucial information behind Draws. Players cannot make smart decisions if they are blinded.

**Failure Means Complication**

- Failure imposes Complication which should be rooted in the fiction. Time lost, harm suffered, trust broken, supplies spent, etc.
- If no Complication makes sense, let failure be the complication and move forward.
- If something is impossible, explain why through the fiction.

**Threat, Not Numbers**

- Enemies and hazards do not need stats. Describe what they do, how dangerous they are, and let the fiction decide.
- Minor threats deal 1 Vitae or Faith. Serious threats deal 2. Dire threats deal 3 or more.
- Armored foes take more strikes. Ethereal foes might not fall to steel. Describe what happens, then let the players adapt.

**Reward Ingenuity**

- Gifts, Records, and preparation should matter. Give players opportunities to use what they have.
- Clever plans, the right gear, or an ally's help may reduce risk to the point where a challenge is no longer one and success is simply given.
- The rules serve the fiction. When in doubt, look at what makes sense in the story.

**NPCs Are People**

- Non-player characters have goals, fears, and reasons to exist. They are not obstacles or quest-givers.
- Most will talk before fighting. Most will flee before dying. Most remember debts and grudges.
- Let NPC decisions emerge from who they are and what they want.

**The Hunt Guides**

- Use the Hunt to frame scenes, establish stakes, and create urgency. Each Hunt is a journey into the thorns.
- When the fiction stalls, return to the Hunt. What stands in the way? What has changed? What is the next step?
- Completing a Hunt is a reward. Make it mean something. Let the characters catch their breath before the next one begins.

### Principles for Players

**Records Are Tools**

- Core Scores and Reserve Scores do not define the character. They are tools to help the mechanics.
- Records mark the character's journey. Invoke them when they help, accept when they complicate.
- Think like a problem-solver.

**Fiction Triggers Actions**

- Describe what the character does first. If it matches an Action's trigger, then Draw to see how it unfolds.
- Actions are only used when their trigger condition is met. Do not Draw unless the fiction calls for it.
- When an Action is triggered, embrace it. The mechanics create interesting situations and complications.

**Press Forward**

- The forest waits for no one. Keep moving, keep deciding, keep the fiction alive.
- When uncertain, consult the Oracle or reveal a card for inspiration.
- Be bold. The mechanics exist to support decisive action, not to punish it.

**Respect the Fiction**

- The fiction determines what is possible. A sword cannot harm what it cannot reach. Corruption does not vanish because of a single success.
- Ask questions. Listen to the answers. The GM provides information freely. Use it to make informed choices.
- Respect the stakes. When the GM says something is dangerous, believe them.

**Embrace Complications**

- Failure creates complications and turns the story in new directions.
- Accept hardship when it serves the story. Restore Fortune when the moment feels right.
- Let wounds, debts, and corruption shape who the character becomes over time.

**Work Together**

- The mission is what holds the group together. Honor it.
- Work together to overcome obstacles. Share Advantage, share risk, share the weight.
- When a character falls, create someone new and bring them into the fiction quickly. The Hunt continues.

### Principles for Solo Play

**Trust the Oracle**

- Consult the Oracle freely. Use it to determine what happens when uncertain.
- Frame questions as yes or no. Let the Oracle shape the path in broad strokes.
- When the Oracle gives a twist, lean into it. Unexpected results create the best stories.

**Play to Find Out**

- Do not plan the entire Hunt. Discover it through play.
- Use Oracle Sparks to generate ideas when stuck. Reveal cards and interpret them through the lens of the fiction.
- Let NPCs surprise the character. Decide their goals, then ask the Oracle how they react.

**Structure of Play**

- Begin each scene by establishing where the character is and what they are doing. Use the Oracle to answer questions about the environment.
- As the character acts, check if their actions trigger any Actions. If so, Draw to resolve.
- When a scene concludes, fast forward to the next moment of uncertainty or use the Oracle to determine what happens next.

**Be Fair, Not Kind**

- Respect the fiction. If the character is outmatched, they are outmatched.
- Impose Costs when they make sense. Let the character suffer setbacks and complications.
- The keep the stakes are real, do not fudge Draws or ignore bad results.

**Pace Yourself**

- A Hunt should take multiple sessions. Let it unfold over time.
- Rest, resupply, and purify between major obstacles. Give the character breathing room.
- When the Hunt completes, take time to reflect before starting the next one.

## Getting Started

### The Opening Scene

Each player introduces their character: their name, what they look like, and one memory from before they died to the roots only to be brought back as a cursed soul. Then frame the opening: the group is already mid-mission, deep in the thorns, with their Hunt half-complete and trouble closing in.

### The Hunt

A Hunt is a mission, the purpose that keeps the Order's mercy pointed forward. When the group completes a Hunt, the group takes on a new Hunt.

To generate a Hunt, draw one card from each table and combine the results. Or choose elements that speak to you.
