Writing Guidelines

- Use Pascal Case for all mechanical terms: Success, Partial Success, Draw, Vitae, Radiance, Cost, Harm, and so on.
- Reserve the term Draw for the core resolution mechanic only. Use reveal when showing cards for tables, oracles, or random procedures.
- Write in third person only. Use the character, the player, or themselves. Never use you, your, or yourself.
- Use the Oxford comma in all lists.
- Avoid contractions. Write is not, do not, and cannot instead of isn't, don't, and can't.
- List card suits in this order: Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, Hearts.
- Phrase Action outcomes as: The character succeeds/fails, [present participle]. For example: The character succeeds, gaining 1 Advantage.

Action Format:

1. Heading: Use level 4 heading (####) with the Action name.
2. Trigger: Start with "When a character [does something], Draw+[Score]." Use "Draw+appropriate Score" if multiple Scores apply.
3. Score Options (if appropriate Score): Use a bullet list starting with "If the character acts..." followed by "- With [method]: Draw+[Score]." End with "- If nothing else applies: Draw+Fortune."
4. Situational Modifiers: Use a blockquote (>) with "If [favorable condition], take 1 Advantage. If [unfavorable condition], take 1 Disadvantage."
5. Resolution Intro: Add "Then, resolve the Action as follows:" before the outcomes.
6. Outcomes: Use a bullet list with "- **On a Success/Partial Success/Failure**: The character succeeds/fails, [present participle]..."
7. Cost Table (optional): Add "On a Partial Success, reveal a card to determine the nature of the Cost:" followed by a suit-based bullet list in Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, Hearts order.

**Wardens of the Duskwatch**

A penitent walks into the Derweald to keep their vows. The forest takes them back, piece by piece.

## The Derweald

The Derweald is a living rot: ancient, patient, and eternally hungry. Its roots burrow through soil and soul alike, drinking names, memories, and blood. What dies beneath its boughs does not rest. The dead rise again as Pallids: bark-bound, hollow-eyed, and mindless, thralls to spirits the Church of the One Light swore it had vanquished centuries ago.

But when the claiming comes swift as the wind, a rare few rise again with their minds intact, cursed with gifts they never asked for and the forest's hooks buried deep in their thoughts. These creatures are power, hunger, and forever. They are called Thornmouths.

The Order of the Duskwatch hunts Thornmouths without mercy and searches for those with resolve enough to fight the pull of the roots through Radiance and faith to welcome into their ranks as Wardens. The Order's priests carve root scars into their forearms with consecrated steel and pack the wounds with blessed salt until the flesh rises into knotted patterns. Body and soul both becoming a battleground.

Armed with blessed blades, whispered prayers, and salted steel, the Wardens are sent back into the thorns to fulfill their Vows, or die trying.

## What Is Needed

One standard deck of cards shared among the table, paper, and pencil. The game can be played solo, cooperatively without a Game Master (GM), or with a GM and one to four players.

Card values follow this scale: Aces count as 1, numbered cards use their normal value, and face cards are valued at 11 for Jacks, 12 for Queens, and 13 for Kings.

Place used cards in a discard pile. When the deck runs empty, or whenever revealing a Joker, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

## Making a Character

Players take a piece of paper (this will act as their character sheet) and then go through the following steps:

### 1. Name

Each player writes their own name on their character sheet.

### 2. Character Name

The player chooses a name for their character.

### 3. Scores

Scores measure a character's capabilities and resources.

**Core Scores** range from 0 to 5. During character creation, players distribute 8 points among the four Core Scores, with no single Score exceeding 3:

- **Strength**: Physical power. Governs brute force, heavy blows, and feats of might.
- **Dexterity**: Agility and precision. Governs quick reflexes, acrobatics, stealth, and ranged attacks.
- **Willpower**: Mental fortitude and presence. Governs resolve, perception, persuasion, and resisting corruption.
- **Constitution**: Endurance and toughness. Governs resilience, stamina, and resistance to physical hardship.

**Reserve Scores** fluctuate during play. All start at 5 during character creation, except Fortune which starts at 3:

- **Vitae (5)**: Physical and mental health.
- **Radiance (5)**: Inner light and resistance to corruption.
- **Supply (5)**: Provisions, ammunition, and expendable gear.
- **Fortune (3)**: Luck and fate's favor.

### 4. Records

Records are used to keep track of important facts about a character: specific items, bonds with non-player characters, pieces of intel, clues, lasting wounds, or other important notes. There is no limit to how many Records a character can have. Relevant Records can help or hinder a character when tackling challenging tasks or when trying to avoid a direct threat.

During character creation, the player reveals a card for each category to determine their starting Records:

- **Weapon** (reveal 1): 1. Sword, 2. Axe, 3. Spear, 4. Bow, 5. Flail, 6. Dagger, 7. Mace, 8. Greatsword, 9. Crossbow, 10. Halberd, Jack. Warhammer, Queen. Quarterstaff, King. Whip
- **Armor** (reveal 1): 1–3. Cloak or Clothes, 4–6. Leather, 7–9. Chain, 10–11. Plate, 12–13. Shield
- **Gear** (reveal 3): 1. Lantern, 2. Rope, 3. Crowbar, 4. Lockpicks, 5. Chain, 6. Grapnel, 7. Torch, 8. Vials, 9. Compass, 10. Spikes, Jack. Mirror, Queen. Chalk, King. Trap Kit
- **Skill** (reveal 1): 1. Herbalist, 2. Blademaster, 3. Marksman, 4. Ritualist, 5. Beast Tamer, 6. Duelist, 7. Scout, 8. Magehunter, 9. Pathfinder, 10. Skirmisher, Jack. Shadowblade, Queen. Deathseeker, King. Spellbreaker

### 5. Gift

A Gift is power stolen from the Derweald and held by rite and restraint. Each character has one, added as a Record. During character creation, players choose one gift:

- **Stonehide**: Flesh hardens like stone, making it extremely hard to be wounded.
- **Bonegrind**: Channel brutal force, gaining unnatural strength.
- **Vinewright**: Control the roots and thorns to entangle, snare, pierce, or drag.
- **Wildtongue**: Command the warped creatures of the forest to do your bidding.
- **Soulgrip**: Seize hold of another's emotions and bend them to your will.

## Rules

### The Oracle

The Oracle is used to answer questions when the fiction is uncertain. It can be consulted freely during play to resolve unknowns, or triggered by specific Actions. To consult the Oracle, frame a yes-or-no question and reveal cards based on likelihood:

| Likelihood     | Cards |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Almost Certain | 4     |
| Likely         | 3     |
| 50/50          | 2     |
| Unlikely       | 1     |

- When there are more red cards (Diamonds or Hearts) than black, the answer is **Yes**.
- When there are more black cards (Clubs or Spades) than red, the answer is **No**.
- When there is a tie, the answer is **Yes, but...** the results are extreme or there is an unexpected twist.

### Oracle Sparks

If after consulting the Oracle a player is still uncertain how things should unfold or how the result should be interpreted, the player reveals 2 cards from the deck. Match the first card to the Theme Spark table and the second to the Impulse Spark table to generate a creative prompt.

**Theme Spark** (reveal first card)

### The Draw

All of the game's following mechanics are called Actions: things that trigger when characters do certain things in the fiction. When an Action is triggered, it will outline that the player must make a Draw, usually in the form of "When this happens, Draw+Score." Follow the steps below to resolve the Action's outcome.

#### Making a Draw

The player draws 1 Action card and adds the relevant Score to the card's numeral value. Then, 2 Challenge cards are drawn. The player compares their Action total against each Challenge card.

If the player's Action total is higher than both Challenge cards, the Action resolves as a **Success**. The character succeeds at what they were trying to do, and do so with a greater effect.

If the player's Action total is higher than one Challenge card, the Action resolves as a **Partial Success**. The character succeeds, but with a lesser effect or at a cost.

If the player's Action total is higher than neither Challenge card, the Action resolves as a **Failure**. The character fails at their action.

Each Action provides prompts to help determine what that Cost might be.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage comes from favorable conditions, preparation, relevant Records, or invoking a Gift. For each level of Advantage, add +1 to the Action total.

Disadvantage comes from adverse conditions, wounds, missing gear, or hostile circumstances. For each level of Disadvantage, subtract 1 from the Action total.

### Actions

#### Overcome an Obstacle

When a character faces a challenge, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character acts...

- With brute force, aggression, or raw power: Draw+Strength.
- With speed, agility, precision, or stealth: Draw+Dexterity.
- With cunning, perception, persuasion, or mental fortitude: Draw+Willpower.
- With endurance, resilience, or toughness: Draw+Constitution.
- If nothing else applies: Draw+Fortune.

> If the character is well-prepared or conditions are favorable, take 1 Advantage. If the character is hindered or conditions are hostile, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, gaining 1 Advantage they can use on a future Action.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, but with lesser impact or facing a Cost.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails.

On a Partial Success, reveal a card to determine the nature of the Cost:

- **♣ Clubs**: Time. The character loses precious time or an opportunity slips away.
- **♠ Spades**: Danger. The character suffers Harm or attracts a threat.
- **♦ Diamonds**: Loss. The character loses Supply or valuable gear is damaged.
- **♥ Hearts**: Trust. A relationship is strained or an ally is put at risk.

#### Avoid a Consequence

When a character tries to avoid a consequence from a hazard, hostile opposition, or dangerous environment, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character reacts...

- With brute force, blocking, or standing firm: Draw+Strength.
- With speed, dodging, or quick reflexes: Draw+Dexterity.
- With focus, willpower, or mental resistance: Draw+Willpower.
- With endurance, resilience, or toughness: Draw+Constitution.
- If nothing else applies: Draw+Fortune.

> If the threat is serious, take 1 Disadvantage. If the threat is dire, take 2 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, avoiding the consequence entirely.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, suffering a lesser consequence. When suffering Harm, lose 1 Vitae. When fighting corruption, lose 1 Radiance. If nothing else applies, the consequence is rooted in the fiction.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails, suffering the full consequence. When suffering Harm, lose 2 Vitae. When fighting corruption, lose 2 Radiance. If nothing else applies, the consequence is rooted in the fiction.

#### Secure an Opportunity

- With positioning, misdirection, or quick movement: Draw+Dexterity.
- With patience or holding ground: Draw+Constitution.
- With careful planning, insight, or deception: Draw+Willpower.
- If nothing else applies: Draw+Fortune.

> If the character has time to prepare or the situation is calm, take 1 Advantage. If the character is rushed or under pressure, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, creating 2 Advantage that can be used on a future Action that leverages that opportunity.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, creating 1 Advantage that can be used on a future Action that leverages that opportunity.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails, taking 1 Disadvantage on their next Action.

On a Partial Success, reveal a card to determine the nature of the Cost:

- **♦ Diamonds**: Loss. The character loses Supply or valuable gear is damaged.
- **♥ Hearts**: Trust. A relationship is strained or an ally is put at risk.

- With threats, intimidation, or a show of force: Draw+Strength.
- With persuasion, deception, or manipulation: Draw+Willpower.
- By offering payment, bribes, or trade: Draw+Supply.
- If nothing else applies: Draw+Fortune.

> If the target is friendly or owes the character, take 1 Advantage. If the target is hostile or has reason to resist, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, compelling the target to comply fully or reveal hidden information.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, but the target demands something in return or remembers this slight.

On a Partial Success, reveal a card to determine the nature of the Cost:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, forming a bond. Add them as a Record, creating 2 Advantage that can be used on a future Action that leverages this relationship.

- **On a Failure**: The character fails, leaving the other party distant or suspicious.

On a Partial Success, reveal a card to determine the nature of the Cost:

- **♣ Clubs**: Obligation. The bond comes with an expectation or duty.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, learning something valuable. Add it as a Record, creating 2 Advantage that can be used on a future Action that leverages this information.

- **On a Failure**: The character fails, finding nothing or stumbling into danger.

- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, engaging on equal footing.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails, losing initiative and taking 1 Disadvantage on their next Action.

There is no turn order or rounds. This Action establishes who acts first, then the fiction flows back and forth between the characters and their enemies.

#### Inflict Harm

When a character strikes at an enemy or engages a threat in combat, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character attacks...

- With a melee weapon or bare hands: Draw+Strength.
- With a ranged weapon or thrown object: Draw+Dexterity.
- With arcane power or a Gift: Draw+Willpower.

The fiction dictates what is possible during combat. A blade cannot harm what it cannot reach. An armored creature will not fall to desperate slashing.

> If the character has the upper hand or the enemy is exposed, take 1 Advantage. If the enemy is armored, fortified, or has the upper hand, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, striking true and avoiding retaliation.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, landing the strike but suffering Harm in return.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails, missing and suffering Harm in return.

Minor threats fall in one or two decisive blows. Dangerous foes require multiple successes: each one is ground gained, a wound opened, an advantage seized.

When a character's Vitae reaches 0, the character is on the brink of death. Draw+Fortune.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, clinging to life. Stabilize at 1 Vitae and remain conscious.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, barely surviving. Stabilize at 1 Vitae but fall unconscious or suffer a permanent wound as a Record.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails. Death claims them.

#### Resist the Forest

When a character's Radiance reaches 0, the pull of the forest threatens to consume them. Draw+Fortune.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, resisting the call. Stabilize at 1 Radiance and maintain their will.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, holding on as the roots take hold. Stabilize at 1 Radiance but gain a permanent mark of corruption as a Record.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails. The forest claims them, removing them from play as they become a threat to former allies.

#### Rest

When a character spends significant time resting, Draw+appropriate Score. If the character rests...

- In a safe place or shelter: Draw+Constitution.
- In the wilds or while on the move: Draw+Supply.

> If the area is sheltered or defensible, take 1 Advantage. If the character takes a Full Rest (days in true sanctuary), take 2 Advantage. If the area is exposed or deep in corrupted territory, take 1 Disadvantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, resting fully. Restore 3 Vitae.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, resting adequately. Restore 2 Vitae, but face a Cost.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails, resting poorly. Restore 1 Vitae.

On a Partial Success, reveal a card to determine the nature of the Cost:

- **♠ Spades**: Disturbance. Something stirs in the night, danger approaches.
- **♦ Diamonds**: Consumption. Supplies are depleted or gear is damaged. Lose 1 Supply.
- **♥ Hearts**: Unease. Nightmares or troubled thoughts strain the mind. Lose 1 Radiance.

After a character has rested, shuffle the discard pile back into the deck.

#### Purify

When a character seeks to cleanse their soul and resist the forest's claim, Draw+Willpower.

> If the character is at a place of holiness (a shrine, altar, sacred grove, or sanctuary blessed by the Church), take 1 Advantage. If the character performs a rite of purification (confessing sins at a relic, holding vigil while fasting, praying over running water, or pouring blood into salt), take 1 Advantage.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, cleansing deeply. Restore 3 Radiance.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, cleansing partially. Restore 2 Radiance.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails, barely touching the corruption. Restore 1 Radiance.

#### Invoke Gift

When a character calls upon their Gift to overcome an obstacle or solve a problem, Draw+Willpower.

Then, resolve the Action as follows:

- **On a Success**: The character succeeds, resisting the call of the roots. Radiance stays as it is.
- **On a Partial Success**: The character succeeds, feeling the call of the roots. Lose 1 Radiance.
- **On a Failure**: The character fails, overwhelmed by the call of the roots. Lose 2 Radiance.

If a character's Radiance ever reaches 0, the forest claims the character. They are removed from play and become a threat to those they once called allies.

## Getting Started

### The Opening Scene

Each player introduces their character: their name, what they look like, and one memory from before the claiming. Then frame the opening: the group is already mid-mission, deep in the thorns, with their Vow half-complete and trouble closing in.

### Group Vow

A Vow is a mission, the purpose that keeps the Order's mercy pointed forward. When the group completes a Vow, each character restores their Radiance to 5 and the group takes on a new Vow.

To generate a Vow, draw one card from each table and combine the results. Or choose elements that speak to you.
