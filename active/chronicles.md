# SETTING

Since the first breaths of the world, spirits have been keen on crossing the bridge between their realm and ours. Some once mistook them for gods. There are no gods.
The Church of the One Light despised the spirits, calling them abominations. Driven by holy fury, they gathered their army and marched through the veiled gates to purge the unseen from existence. The spirits were eradicated, their arcane essence torn apart and scattered like leaves in a storm.
The magical energy that spilled from the spirits seeped into every crack of the world, bleeding into soil, stone, and sky. Common folk harvested this power to craft humble charms, while scholars shaped it into incantations capable of bending the laws of reality itself.

Fearing a loss of power and control over the people of Lightfall, the Church declared the use of magic a divine right reserved for their order alone. Those who defied them were branded heretics, tortured, and executed beneath the radiant banners of the One Light.
Death has no hold on spirits. When the veil tore once more, it did so in the Derwealds. Thorned vines and slick fungal growths erupted from the soil like a living plague.
The oily roots consumed kingdoms and souls alike. As the fallen exhaled their final breath, their bodies warped into wooden husks bound by ancient wills, driven to march against the last bastions of warmth and light with their bark soaked with the blood of those who fed their endless hunger.
In that dark hour, the spirits walked the land once more.
So much of the realm was lost to the forest's embrace. Castles, cities, palaces, dungeons, villages all swallowed whole. Nowhere was safe.  
Yet within the devouring dark, tangled in roots and decay, lie countless vaults. Artifacts, treasures, gold, and unfathomable knowledge. Sparks bright enough to outlast the dark for one more day.
The depths call to the brave and foolish alike with so many returning with lopsided grins and bright eyes, pockets heavy with dirt instead of gold.
Many try their way in the woods, seeking what lies in the darkness. But the blighted roots have a will of their own now. Ever creeping on the ground where death, decay, and spirits waltz eternally on the ravenous maw of chaos itself.
Lightfall
This game holds no complete accounting of the world of Lightfall's, nor does it matter. Such a thing would be both impossible and unnecessary. What follows are basic truths, foundations upon which to build your game. The rest is either or hinted left deliberately unwritten. Gaps exist by design so you may fill them as you see fit. This is your game. Take these as starting points and make this world your own.
The Land: Once, spirits wandered freely across these lands, feeding on the emotions of the living. The Church of the One Light rose against them. The war burned, until the Church stood alone upon the ash.
Spirits: Spirits cannot die. Their essence breaks and drifts to the edges of the world, where it festers and gathers strength. In time, they return.
Arcane: When the spirits fell, their dying essence bled into the air and the world drank deep. From that breath came the arcane. The Church seized it, naming it holy gift, proof of the One Light’s glory. Those who draw upon it without their blessing are dragged to the rope or the pyre.
One Light: The Church claims to live in the grace of its god, the One Light. But there are no gods, and there never were. Only the highest clergy know this truth, and they will burn kingdoms to keep it buried.
Derweald: Once a quiet grove, the Derweald grew foul as spirits gathered within its heart. Its border began as a thin line, then swelled like rot beneath the skin. Within, the veil between flesh and spirit blurs. The roots whisper promises of treasure and wonder, luring travelers to their doom and feast on fear and greed alike. The forest grows without end, stealing the dead and twisting them into hollow soldiers made of bark and shadows. The longer the roots take to claim a body, the more docile the husk becomes. Those taken early sometimes keep their will, but must always bend to the forest’s power.
The Remaining Bastions
The roots have consumed much of the land. Here are the regions known to still be standing.
Kelmora (North): An icy bay where survival is an oath and broken vows bite harder than frozen wind. The Barahl Clans were once dragon feared raiders, but more than a hundred winters, they've lived beneath The Iron Rule battling Ithril the Calamity whose old powers turned their wyrms into enemies. Blood has frozen on that ice more times than anyone will count but living this far north spared them from the Derweald's hold. Mostly. But the frost is thinning, and the roots are coming.
The Free Cities (West): Velmoor feeds them all, though each dawn the Derweald presses further and the Bright Mages burn their strength to hold the line. Out at sea, Naranth is starving. Nets rise empty, boats return light, and those who with the means try to flee to Eslora, the haven that holds the grand cathedral of the One Light. On clear days, the Shattered Isles cut the horizon, and the omen is plain: whatever the remaining citizens of the Free Cities try to do do, the same ruin that consumed these islands is coming for them too.
The Mireroads (Heart): The Mireroads wind through open plains and light forests that drown in wide, reeking marshes. A chain of market towns once swollen on trade now lie trapped between the Derweald’s tainted roots, the wild sea toward Kelmora, and the jagged peaks of the Ashen Teeth. Long ago the land crawled with trolls, goblins, giant owls, ghouls, and worse but those creatures were driven back by torch and blade so merchants might travel unafraid. As the roads were swallowed by the forest’s tangles, those same horrors crept out again to claim their old hunting grounds. Famine came, then sickness. Far from the Free Cities, the Church of the One Light holds only a flickering presence. New creeds and beliefs spread in their place, murmuring that only offerings to the woods and the restless spirits can keep salvation close. The same sort of superstition as the ghostly lights seen burning over the mountain range where Saltmere once stood.
Concepts
Here are some basic concepts and terms to help you familiarize yourself this game and how it plays.
Dice: This game uses six-sided dice (shortened as D) for most of its rules and procedures.When rolling dice, each 5 or 6 counts as a Hit; all other results are a Miss. The more Hits a roll yields, the better the outcome.
This Game: A collaborative adventure where players explore perilous places, make meaningful choices, and face the consequences that shape an emergent story.
The Fiction: The shared imaginary world where play happens. It is independent of the players’ wishes and operates according to its own laws.
The Game Moderator (GM): The neutral voice of the world. The GM describes what the characters perceive, presents problems to them, and decides when rules apply. Their goal is to give players enough information so they can devise clever plans that outsmart the world.
The Player: Each player controls a single character within the fiction. Their goal is to interpret what their character sees and feels, ask questions about the world to the GM and make choices based on the answers in a way that is aligned with what their character would do.
The Rules: The mechanics and procedures used to resolve uncertainty, judge danger, and determine consequences. When a situation isn’t covered by an existing rule, the GM can create a new ruling based on common sense.
The Conversation: Play unfolds as an ongoing dialogue: the GM describes a scene, players ask questions, the GM answers truthfully, and players declare what their characters do. All resolve their actions through the established fiction or rules, the world shifts, and the conversation carries on.

Go through the following steps or pick a backgrounds on p. XX.
I. Attributes
Roll 4D for each Attribute (Strength, Dexterity, and Willpower); each Hit adds 1 to the score. You may switch two Attribute scores of your choice. If the total across all Attribute scores is less than 3, start again.
Alternatively, you may assign 5 points among the three Attributes, with no single Attribute starting higher than 3.
II. Stamina
Start with 6 Stamina. It represents your character's ability to push through physical or mental strain.
III. Hit Points (HP)
Start with HP equal to 2 + your character's Strength score.They are a measure of your character's ability to avoid life-threatening damage.
IV. Items
Use the rolling tables on the next pages to add 5 Items to your character's inventory (1 Weapon, 1 Armor, a number of Coins, and 3 other Items). Then roll for the 1 Keepsake your character always carries for good luck.
V. Name and Details
Give your character a name using the table at the start of this book, then add a few details to bring them to life. You can choose these details yourself or roll for them using the tables on the following pages.

# Basic Rules

Here are the basic concepts you need to know to play the game, along with the rules that define a player character.
Dice, Hits and Misses
When rolling dice, each 5 or 6 counts as a Hit; all other results are a Miss. If you ever need to roll 0D, roll 1D but only a 6 is a Hit.
Pools
A Pool is a set of dice (2D, 4D, 6D, or 8D) which is rolled over time to track time, impending events and resources. 
After it is rolled, it shrinks by one die for every Miss, but never more than its set limit, usually 2. When emptied, the fiction changes and the Pool is cleared. 
Player Characters
Every character is made of the following parts.
Attributes
Attributes represent how capable your character is when facing risky actions. These are:
› Strength: Fortitude, toughness, and melee attacks.
› Dexterity: Finesse, agility, and ranged attacks.
› Willpower: Charisma, focus, spells, and sorcery.
At character creation, pick between:

A) Roll 4D for each Attribute; each Hit adds 1 to the score. You may switch two Attribute scores of your choice. If the total across all Attribute scores is less than 3, start again.
B) Assign 5 points among the three Attributes, with no single Attribute starting higher than 3.
Stamina
Stamina represents your character’s ability to push through physical or mental strain. 
It can be spent to add dice on specific rolls, and it is the main resource they rely on to avoid the consequences of risky actions or dangers in the fiction.
At character creation, start with 6 Stamina.
Hit Points
Hit Points (HP) are a measure of your character’s ability to avoid life-threatening Damage. 
When your character takes Damage, they lose that many HP, but they recover all HP as soon they have a few minutes to catch their breath.
At character creation, start with HP equal to 2 + your character's Strength score.
Items and Conditions
Items represent the gear your character carries. 
Start with 3 Items of your choice and a small keepsake for good luck.
Your character has 10 Slots. Most Items take 1 Slot, petty ones none, and bulky ones 2.
When afflicted by Conditions such as fatigue, sickness, deprivation, poison, etc., fill a Slot with the Condition's name. If no Slot is free, drop an Item to make room. 
Conditions always hinder characters and can make certain actions more difficult or outright impossible. Certain types of Conditions can worsen, taking more Slots over time. 
If all Slots are filled, your character drops to 1 HP. If more than half are taken by Conditions, they fall unconscious. Conditions are only cleared through actions in the fiction.
Core Rules
Here are the rules that handle how characters confront risks, resist consequences, recover and grow stronger.
Checks
When your character does something challenging, assess the risk. A clever plan, the right Item, an ally’s help, or the fiction may increase the action’s impact, lessen the severity of consequences, or remove the need for a Check entirely. If the action is still considered risky, make a Check by rolling a number of dice equal to a relevant Attribute score (Strength, Dexterity, Willpower). You may also spend any number of Stamina; each point adding 1D to the roll.
If you would roll 0D, roll 1D but only a 6 counts as a Hit.
› 1+ Hits: Your character succeeds at their action.
› 0 Hits: Your character fails their action.
Extremely difficult tasks may raise the number of Hits required to succeed a Check depending on the situation.
Saves
Failing a Check or other events in the fiction may trigger consequences such as taking Damage, suffering a Condition, or even dying when death is on the line. If avoiding the consequence is still possible, make a Save by rolling a number of dice equal to your character's current amount of Stamina.
If you would roll 0D, roll 1D but only a 6 counts as a Hit.
› 1+ Hits: Your character avoids the consequence. 
› 0 Hits: Your character suffers the consequence. 
After the roll, reduce your character's Stamina by 1 for every Miss, up to a maximum of 2. Extremely dangerous consequences may raise the number of Hits required to succeed a Save depending on the situation.
Damage and Death Saves
When your character takes Damage, they lose that many HP. When they reach 0 HP, they are in critical danger and you must make a Death Save by rolling a number of dice equal to your character's current Strength score.
If you would roll 0D, roll 1D but only a 6 counts as a Hit.
› 1+ Hits: Your character is wounded but endures.
› 0 Hits: Your character is out and will die unless helped.
After the roll, reduce your character's Strength score by 1 for every Miss, up to a maximum of 2. Attribute scores cannot drop below 0. 
Taking Damage while at 0 HP immediately triggers another Death Save.
Recovery
Your character can recover in two ways.
Short Rest
A few minutes of respite restores all Stamina and HP. Resting may waste time or attract danger. 
Full Rest
A week of safety and shelter restores all Stamina, HP, and Attribute scores.
Advancements
After a major milestone in the story, roll 3D; each Hit increases your character’s maximum HP by 1. Then roll 2D; if you rolled at least 1 Hit, raise one Attribute score of your choice by 1, up to a maximum of 6.
A milestone could happen after completing a perilous quest or expedition, uncovering a hidden treasure or ancient artifact, or defeating a powerful foe that marks a turning point in the adventure.
Combat Rules
Here are the rules that handle combat encounters.
Initiative
At the start of each round, every participant rolls 1D for initiative and acts in order from highest result to lowest. 
Enemies act first on ties, while those caught off guard always act last. Two players may also swap their initiative dice as long as neither has taken a turn yet. 
Weapons, Armor, and Enemies
› Weapons: Weapons have a Damage Rating and deal that much Damage when used to harm an enemy.
› Armor: Armor has a number of HP. Damage first reduces Armor HP, then your character’s HP. When depleted, it remains broken until repaired or replaced in the fiction.
› Enemies: Each enemy has a number of HP and a set of Attacks, each with its own Damage Rating. At 0 HP, they are taken out. Some powerful enemies are divided into phases, each with its own HP and Attacks. When a phase is reduced to 0 HP, move to the next phase at its full HP. Damage does not carry over from one phase to the next.
A round lasts long enough to perform one action (harm an enemy, cast a spell, retreat, etc.) and move across a standard-sized room. 
Players roll to attack and to defend; enemies don't roll dice.
› Attack: Make a Check to harm an enemy. If it succeeds, deal Damage equal to the Weapon's Damage Rating. For hazards or spells without a set Damage Rating, assign a fair amount based on the situation.
› Defend: Make a Save to defend against an Attack. If it fails, take Damage equal to the Attack's Damage Rating.
› Other Actions: When taking an action that is not a direct attack, assess if it is risky; if it is, make Check as an action to determine how it plays out.
OTher Rules
Here are the rules that handle various other aspects that you may want to be supported by mechanics as you play the game.
Fortune Roll
When the outcome of an event or action is uncertain, and you want to simulate an element of randomness and chance, make a Fortune Roll. 
Frame the situation as a yes or no question, then roll a number of dice based on how likely the outcome feels in the fiction.
› If it feels very likely, roll 4D.
› If it feels likely, roll 3D.
› If it feels even, roll 2D.
› If it feels unlikely, roll 1D.
› If it feels very unlikely, roll 0D.
You may also use an Attribute score as a basis for the roll if a character’s abilities can influence the outcome. If two parties are directly opposed, roll for each side and compare the number of Hits to see who comes out ahead.
› 1+ Hits: The answer is yes, extra Hits amplify the effect.
› 0 Hits: The answer is no.
Encounter Rolls
As your character explores dangerous locations or travels overland, they may come across unexpected encounters. Each time they stop to rest, search an area, or do anything that might draw attention, make an Encounter Roll, rolling a number of dice based on how likely an encounter could occur in the fiction. If unsure, roll 1D.
› 1+ Hits: Your character spots signs of a nearby presence. Create a 2D Pool, and roll it as events unfold. When the Pool is emptied, your character runs into an encounter.
› 0 Hits: Your character finds no sign of recent activity.
Reaction Rolls
When encountering a non-player character or creature whose reaction toward your character is uncertain, make a Reaction Roll, rolling a number of dice based on the nature of the encounter. If unsure, roll 2D.
› 1+ Hits: They are approachable or friendly. The more Hits you roll, the more welcoming they are.
› 0 Hits: They are distant or hostile.
Morale Pools
Non-player characters and creatures capable of fear or self-preservation have a Morale Pool (2D, 4D, 6D, or 8D). The higher their Morale, the steadier their resolve. Large groups can share a single Morale Pool that reflects the will of the whole. Roll a Morale Pool when a group sees its leader fall or loses half its number, when a lone foe drops to half HP, or when companions, hirelings, or retainers face danger beyond what they expected.
› 1+ Hits: They stand firm or press on. 
› 0 Hits: They falter or break. Enemies may flee, surrender, or freeze. Companions may retreat, demand higher pay, or refuse to follow.
After the roll, shrink their Morale Pool by 1 for every Miss, up to a maximum loss of 2
Torches and Lanterns Pools
When your character is crawling through caverns, dungeons, and other lightless reaches, they will need a steady source of light to find their way and stay alert. 
A lit torch is represented by 4D Pool, while a lit lantern uses a 6D Pool. One light source is usually enough for a whole group of adventurers moving together.
As your character descends into such places, start a 20 minute timer and roll the Pool of the active light source each time the timer expires. After each roll, shrink the Pool by 1 for every Miss, up to a maximum loss of 2. When the Pool is emptied, the light goes out. 
Your character can light a new 4D torch or pour in a fresh flask of oil to bring a lantern back to 6D.
Torches and oil flasks are consumable items, and their remaining quantity is tracked with usage Pools. Each time your character lights a new torch or refills a lantern with an oil flask, roll the item’s usage Pool and shrink it as normal.
Without a proper light source, every Check or Save is rolled with 1 fewer die.
Spells & Rituals
The arcane manifests in two ways. Rituals are slow workings that draw on the lingering flow of spirit energy in the world—they demand rare ingredients, careful preparation, and time. Spells are immediate and powerful casts often fueled by spirit marbles, each containing a fragment of bound spirit power that can be released at a moment’s notice.
Spells
Your character can cast a number of spells per day equal to their current Willpower score given they have the marble tied to that spell or have another way to harness arcane power.
To cast a spell, make a Willpower Check.
› 1+ Hits: The spell takes shape and its effect is unleashed. 
› 0 Hits: The spell slips from your control. Make a Save to contain it; if it fails, add a fatigued Condition in a Slot.
Limited Use Spells
Some marbles have have a limited number of use. These marbles have a Pool (2D, 4D, 6D, 8D) which is rolled everytime they are used. After the roll, the Pool shrinks by 1 die for every Miss, up to a maximum of 2 dice. 
When the Pool is emptied, the marble goes inert and the spell within is fully consumed along with the spirit bound inside.
Marbles of the Ways of the Light always have a fixed number of uses because their power comes from burning the trapped spirit down to nothing.
Rituals
Rituals take time, tools, and ingredients. If your character has all of this, make a Willpower Check.
› 1+ Hits: The ritual works exactly as intended.
› 0 Hits: The ritual works, but its effects are lessened.

# CLASSES

The Unsung Blade
For the most disciplined warriors, their blade is merely the instrument through which they channel their wrath. But, warriors themselves often become instruments of another's will. Once the leash severed or cut, both blade and wielder are left to question their purpose. One fact remains: there are no ballads of glory for deserters.

You clawed your way through the damp dark, carving a life out of the husks of the lost. The roots whispered, and something worse than hunger gnawed at your marrow. “Thornmouths”. The forest took you, taught you, tried to keep you. You learned how to leave it, but it never left you. Now you walk among the living, but will they accept you?

The Gloom Warden
The wood was your cradle. You read its moods like storms while its hunger is like kin do you. Villages sleep soundly because you hold the line between door and dark, but things have changed. The forest has scarred you, claimed its tithe in blood and bone. Yet you remember what it once was, before the crimson roots and the spirits. You hold to that memory, hoping the forest might remember and one day find its way back to what it once was.

The Fallen Leaf
At your veiling, you died and rose with something new. A spirit walks a heartbeat behind you, mimicking, guarding, guiding. The Church calls your people’s tradition blasphemy, but for you it is a covenant older than the crowns of this land. Even though the world is eating your kind away and the rites of old are being forgotten, you are never alone, not in life, not in death.

The Shattered Chalice
You sang the hymns, then heard the lie that held them up. You cracked and spilled. The Light was a throne in disguise, a crown’s mouthpiece for power-hungry men. There are no Gods and never was. You carried your faith to humbler altars, finding the holy in people; in their memories, and in their souls. You walk with patience and fight to preserve. You fight to remember, you fight to protect, and to give others the strength you nearly lost.

# BEASTIARY

Pallid Hounds
Lost souls may fall to the woods, but every manner of beast can also be claimed by the corruption and turned into a pallid puppet for the roots.
Among these twisted creatures, pallid hounds are among the most ferocious.
Their fervor comes from a warped, bestial need to please and obey their unseen master, which means that wherever a pallid hound prowls, its master is never far behind.
The stench of rotting flesh clings to the air as guttural growls shiver through the gloom. They are here. (Wants: to please its master and bring back prizes.)

Hit Points: 2
Attacks:
— Bite: 2 Damage.
— Rend: 3 Damage.
— Lunge: 2 Damage, and the target drops an Item.
— Screech: The target gains a fear Condition.
— Howl: Roll 6D, every Hit adds a new hound to the pack.
Pallid Shamblers
The Wretched of the Wood. The forest gorged on these souls for so long that flesh became sap, while their memory and will were lost to time and rot. They are hollowed monuments, bone and root woven into a shape that once held a name.
Without a Thornmouth to speak purpose into them, they sag in place or hunt anything that crosses their path out of both instinct and rage.
The creature moves with a jerky, puppet-like gait, its ribcage rattling against the thick roots that coil where organs used to be. (Wants: to feed)

Hit Points: 3
Attacks:
— Bash: 2 Damage.
— Root-Snare: 1 Damage, and the target gains a grappled Condition.
Thornmouths
Skin pale as marble, eyes pooling with black ichor. Beautiful and eternal. They remember their former lives, but they are something new now.
Taken early by the roots, their bodies are frozen in time, still very much human in all the wrong ways. Each Thornmouth rises with a gift that is theirs alone, but all exert power and command over pallid hounds and shamblers. Yet even with all that willpower, they must always bend to the forces that gave them a second chance.
It's looking at you and you feel absolutely worthless. You are nothing and they are forever. (Wants to live, to become more powerful, and to break their own chains.)

PHASE I
Hit Points: 5
Attacks:
— Whistle: Call 1D worth of hounds to fight.
— Command: Call 1D worth of shamblers to fight.

PHASE II: Roll 6D. If the roll yields at least 1 Hit, the
Thorthmouth disolves into the roots and tries to escape. Otherwise, they stay and unleash everything they have.
Hit Points: 20
Attacks:
— Voice of Ruin: 3 Damage to every target in range and anyone who ever used corrupted magic must obey the thornmouth for 1D rounds.
— Dismemberment: Roots erupt and tear a limb free (1-2 an arm, 3-4 a leg, 5-6 the head).
— Thornlance: 10 Damage.
— Pallid Monstrosity: Merges 1D worth of pallid creatures into one warped mass under the Thornmouth’s control with a total of 5 HP per creature merged.
