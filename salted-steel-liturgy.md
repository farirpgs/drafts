**The Rites of Steel and Salt**

_A Manual for Those Who Walk the Thorns_

---

_Let this be known to all who take the Vow: you walk into the Derweald to keep your oaths. The forest will take you back, piece by piece. This is the price. This is the way._

---

## I. Of the Derweald

The Derweald is a living rot, ancient and hungry. Its roots drink names, memories, and blood. What dies beneath its shadow rises again—bark-bound, hollow-eyed, driven by the forest's will.

Some hunters survive their claiming and keep their will. These scarred ones cut root marks into their forearms with blessed steel and pack the wounds with consecrated salt until they rise into knotted patterns. These scars are testimony: both body and soul are battlegrounds, and the battle is not yet lost.

The Order of the Duskwatch accepts these penitent hunters as Wardens and sends them back into the thorns to complete their Vows. So it has been. So it shall be.

---

## II. Of the Instruments Required

_Before the rite begins, gather these:_

One standard deck of cards, shared among the gathered. Paper and pencil for each soul. One shall serve as Chronicler, keeper of the world's truth. One to four others shall portray the Wardens.

The cards speak thus: Aces count as 1. Numbered cards bear their face value. Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, and Kings are 13.

When a card is drawn and used, it passes to the discard pile. When the deck is exhausted and fate must speak again, the Chronicler gathers the discards and shuffles them anew.

---

## III. Of the Making of a Warden

_Each player takes paper in hand—this shall be the record of their soul—and proceeds through the following rites:_

### The First Rite: The Player's Name

Write your own name upon the record. You are bound to this soul's keeping.

### The Second Rite: The Warden's Name

Choose a name for the one you shepherd through the thorns.

### The Third Rite: The Four Pillars

Every soul is measured by four Pillars. Each ranges from 0 to 6 and determines how many cards are drawn when fate is tested. Distribute 6 points among them, with no single Pillar exceeding 3:

- **Iron**: Strength and endurance. The weight you carry, the blow you strike, the wound you suffer and still stand.
- **Edge**: Agility and precision. The blade turned aside, the silent step, the arrow that finds its mark.
- **Wits**: Cunning and perception. The trap seen before it springs, the lie detected, the pattern in the chaos.
- **Heart**: Willpower and connection. The terror resisted, the beast calmed, the corruption held at bay.

### The Fourth Rite: The Details

Details are the truths that define a Warden—their tools, their skills, their burdens. There is no limit to what may be recorded. A Warden carries what the fiction permits, though the Chronicler speaks final judgment.

Relevant Details may ease or hinder a Warden when facing trials or threats.

_Upon creation, record one Detail from each sacred category:_

- **Weapon**: 1. Sword, 2. Axe, 3. Spear, 4. Bow, 5. Flail, 6. Dagger, 7. Mace, 8. Greatsword, 9. Crossbow, 10. Halberd, Jack. Warhammer, Queen. Quarterstaff, King. Whip
- **Armor**: 1–3. Cloak or Clothes, 4–6. Leather, 7–9. Chain, 10–11. Plate, 12–13. Shield
- **Tools**: 1. Lantern, 2. Rope, 3. Crowbar, 4. Lockpicks, 5. Chain, 6. Grapnel, 7. Torch, 8. Vials, 9. Compass, 10. Spikes, Jack. Mirror, Queen. Chalk, King. Trap Kit
- **Skill**: 1. Herbalist, 2. Blademaster, 3. Marksman, 4. Ritualist, 5. Beast Tamer, 6. Duelist, 7. Scout, 8. Magehunter, 9. Pathfinder, 10. Skirmisher, Jack. Shadowblade, Queen. Deathseeker, King. Spellbreaker

### The Fifth Rite: The Gift

A Gift is power stolen from the Derweald and held by rite and restraint. It is the thorn in your flesh, the ember in your blood. Each Warden carries one, recorded as a Detail. Each time the Gift is invoked, the Pull of corruption grows stronger.

_Choose one burden:_

- **Stonehide**: Flesh hardens like stone. Wounds close before they open.
- **Bonegrind**: Brutal force channels through you. Bones splinter beneath your hands.
- **Vinewright**: The roots and thorns answer your call—to entangle, snare, pierce, or drag.
- **Wildtongue**: The warped creatures of the forest hear your voice and obey.
- **Soulgrip**: You seize hold of another's heart and twist it to your will.

### The Sixth Rite: Harm and Pull

**Harm** tracks the trauma of flesh and mind. When all five boxes are filled, the Warden falls—unconscious, critically wounded, or slain. Mark five empty boxes upon the record.

**Pull** measures the forest's grip upon the soul. It begins at 1. When it reaches 6, the Derweald claims the Warden forever. Mark this number and guard it well.

---

## IV. Of the Testing of Fate

_When a Warden attempts something perilous, or when threat looms upon them, the Chronicler calls for a Test._

First, the Chronicler speaks what is at stake—what failure costs, what consequences wait. Then the Chronicler sets a Difficulty Rating.

### The Difficulty Rating

| Rating | Meaning                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| DR 3   | Routine. Simple, yet failure remains possible.  |
| DR 5   | Simple. Manageable with skill or fortune.       |
| DR 7   | Standard. A meaningful trial.                   |
| DR 9   | Difficult. Only the capable or blessed prevail. |
| DR 11  | Extreme. At the edge of mortal limits.          |

### The Drawing of Cards

The Chronicler names which Pillar applies. The player draws cards equal to that Pillar's value. If the Pillar is 0, draw 2 cards and discard the highest—even the faithless may try.

Relevant Details may raise or lower the Difficulty Rating.

Reveal all drawn cards. Count how many meet or exceed the Rating:

- **Two or more**: _Triumph._ The Warden succeeds decisively—faster, cleaner, or with unexpected advantage.
- **One**: _Success._ The Warden accomplishes what they set out to do.
- **None**: _Failure._ The Warden fails, and the stated consequences fall upon them.

### Extended Trials

Some tasks cannot be resolved in a single moment: combat, pursuits, fortifications, rituals, or journeys through hostile ground. The Chronicler sets a number of successes required—3 for short ordeals, 5 for demanding ones, 7 or more for grueling trials.

Failures carry consequences but do not erase progress. Each card that meets or exceeds the Rating counts as one success toward completion.

---

## V. Of Violence

_There is no order of battle, no measured rounds. The fiction dictates who acts and what is possible._

A blade cannot harm what it cannot reach. An armored thing will not fall to desperate slashing. The Chronicler speaks what the threat does, what it is capable of, and what openings exist. The players speak how their Wardens respond.

When a Warden strikes at an enemy, or when a threat falls upon them, they make a Test. The Chronicler sets the Rating based on the foe.

- **Triumph**: The Warden strikes true and avoids retaliation.
- **Success**: The Warden lands their blow but suffers Harm in turn.
- **Failure**: The Warden misses and suffers Harm regardless.

Minor threats fall in one or two decisive blows. Dangerous foes are Extended Trials—each success is ground gained, a wound opened, an advantage seized. The violence ends when the successes are met or the Wardens are broken.

When the enemy acts unopposed, there is no Test. The Chronicler speaks what happens. Wardens may spend their action to defend, dodge, or retreat instead of attacking.

---

## VI. Of Harm

Harm tracks how much trauma—of flesh or spirit—a Warden can endure before things become critical or mortal. A Warden begins with five empty Harm boxes.

When a Warden suffers Harm, the Chronicler draws cards based on the threat:

| Threat   | Cards Drawn |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Standard | 1           |
| Serious  | 2           |
| Dire     | 3           |

Each black card (Spades or Clubs) fills one Harm box. Red cards (Hearts or Diamonds) are near-misses—painful, but they do not fill boxes.

When all five boxes are filled, the Warden falls unconscious, is critically wounded, or is slain. The Chronicler and player together determine what the moment demands.

### Of Rest and Recovery

_Healing requires time and safety. There is no rest in the thorns._

- **Brief Rest** (minutes of catching breath): Draw 1 card.
- **Long Rest** (hours of shelter and bandages): Draw 2 cards.
- **True Rest** (days in sanctuary): Draw 3 cards.

Each red card clears 1 Harm box. The body mends. The spirit endures.

---

## VII. Of Pull

_The forest remembers what you have taken. It wants it back._

A Warden's Pull represents the Derweald's hold upon their corrupted soul—a creeping tether that tightens with every dark bargain. It begins at 1 and climbs toward 6.

When Pull reaches 6, the forest claims the Warden forever. They are removed from play, fall under the Chronicler's dominion, and become a threat to those they once called kin.

### Invoking the Gift

A Warden may call upon their Gift to solve problems or overcome obstacles. Using a Gift may cancel the need for a Test entirely, or greatly reduce the Difficulty Rating.

But the forest takes its due. Whenever a Gift is invoked, the Warden must make a Pull Check.

**Pull Check**: Draw 1 card. If its value is less than or equal to your current Pull, the Pull increases by 1. The tether tightens.

### The Rite of Purification

A Warden may resist the forest's claim in moments of sanctity. This requires a place of holiness: a shrine, an altar, a sacred grove, or a sanctuary blessed by the Church.

The Warden confesses at a relic. Holds vigil while fasting. Prays over running water. Pours blood into salt.

After the rite, draw 3 cards. For each red card drawn, the Warden's Pull is reduced by 1. The tether loosens. For now.

---

## VIII. Of the First Steps

### The Opening

Each player introduces their Warden: their name, their visage, and one memory from before the claiming. Then the Chronicler frames the opening—the group is already mid-mission, deep in the thorns, with their Vow half-complete and trouble closing in.

_Begin in the middle. The thorns do not wait._

### The Vow

A Vow is a mission—the purpose that keeps the Order's mercy pointed forward. When the group completes a Vow, each Warden fully clears their Pull, and the group takes on a new Vow.

_To generate a Vow, draw one card from each table and combine the results. Or choose what calls to you._

_Go now into the thorns. Keep your Vows. Cut the scars deep, and pack them with salt._

_The forest is patient. But so are we._
