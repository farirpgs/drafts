## THE HARBOR

> Cargo ships line the docks, engines idling. A moat of brackish water surrounds the district. Armed sailors guard the only bridge. Every evening, the ships sail out to the safety of open water, returning at dawn.

- **The moat**: 30 feet wide, 10 feet deep, filthy water with debris. (_Swimming is possible but loud and slow, bridge is only dry crossing_)
- **Checkpoint**: Two checkpoints on bridge, four sailors with rifles at each. (_Turn away most visitors, looking for tribute or proof of legitimate business_)
- **Warehouses**: Three buildings behind chain-link fence. Central has office, western has trade goods, eastern is under repair
  - **Resources**: Rope d10, tarps d8, canned food d10, diesel fuel d10, fishing gear d8, working radio d8
- **Security patrols**: Four-person teams, waterfront every 20 minutes. (_Dogs patrol western perimeter, flashlights at night_)
- **Leader**: Nicole, 40, weathered face, naval jacket, practical demeanor.
  - **Wants**: Information about Springfield warehouses /_or we could tie to the Hospital here_/
  - **Claims**: Springfield is overrun but warehouses have supplies worth recovering
  - **Requests**: Scout Springfield warehouses or clear Breathless from them
    - **Offering**: Job in the Merchant Marines or 1/4 of supplies recovered (step up Journey Die by 3 steps)
  - **Knows**: Gabriel at Angel Bridge is getting aggressive, probably planning something. /_So we can tie to the other Locations _/
  - **IF DOOM CLOCK THINGY IS AT LEVEL 3**: Nicole and all ships are gone, moat unguarded, warehouses abandoned. Whole place is filled with Breathless.
