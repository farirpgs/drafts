Writing Guidelines

- Mechanical terms should always use Pascal Case (e.g., Check, Skill, Item, Position, Grit, Harm, Journey Die)
- Write in third person only. Use the character, the player, or themselves. Never use you, your, or yourself. Exception: flavor text and Memory prompts may use second person.
- Use the Oxford comma in all lists.
- Avoid contractions. Write is not, do not, and cannot instead of isn't, don't, and can't.

# Survival Pamphlet

Everyone got infected. Not one soul escaped that fate. The first sign of infection was memory loss. One moment you knew your name, the next you were staring at strangers with no idea who they were, what year it was, or who you had ever been.

That was the best outcome. For the unlucky ones, it went a step further. Their skin drained pale, their eyes glazed, and every breath came in ragged, furious gasps. They became the Breathless: living dead creatures which tore cities apart and left the world in ruins in mere weeks.

Today, they roam the streets and wilds, hunting the living to feed on their flesh and suck in their last breath, literally.

A single bite from a Breathless wakes the sickness sleeping inside you, and soon you are one of them, swept into their endless swarms.

Now, all that remains is to loot, shoot, and survive.

## Basics

### Content Warning

This game touches on many sensitive subjects. At the end of the day, this game belongs to the table to do whatever they want with. If the group wants certain topics to be removed or included from the game, they should do it. The table should work together to decide what lines should not be crossed and what subjects should be avoided during play. Some topics can be part of the world without needing to be shown "on screen." It is also normal to forget some things during those first talks, and that is OK. If something uncomfortable comes up in play, pause the game and talk about whether it should be cut out of the story or just hidden behind a veil. Once everyone agrees and feels good about the new direction, the group can rewind the story a bit and pick up play again.

### Game Material

To play this game, each player needs a copy of this pamphlet, a full set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12), along with pencils and erasers.

### This Game

This game is a tabletop role-playing game where people come together to collaboratively create a story within a fictional world, using the game’s rules to bring tension, uncertainty, and drama.

There are two types of personas at the table. First are the players, each controlling a character within the narrative. Then there is the game moderator (or GM), whose role is to depict the world, portray non-player characters (or NPCs), guide conversations, and act as a referee when rules or rulings are needed.

A typical flow of play begins with the GM painting a scene, describing what the characters see, hear, smell, and feel. The GM then introduces problems or sources of tension, and waits for the players to decide what their characters will do about it. Players can ask questions about the scene, which the GM must answer honestly. They can also act out or narrate what their characters do. Depending on what the characters do, the GM may simply allow success if there is no real risk, but they could also call for the use of a certain mechanic or rule to determine the outcome.

### GM Guidelines

Guide the story, present challenges to the group. Be a fan of the players. Ask them questions, fill the world with their answers. If it is cool, let them try or split complex challenges into multiple Checks.

### Player Guidelines

Players narrate what their characters do. They make Checks when things are risky. Give everyone a time to shine. Fill the world with ideas. Take risks, and rise up from failures.

## Rules

### Skills

During play, players rely on seven core Skills of their characters to face challenges.

- **Bash** is all about strength and force, whether breaking down a door, pushing through an obstacle, or using raw power to wreck something in the way.
- **Dash** comes into play whenever speed and agility are needed, like sprinting across rooftops, leaping over gaps, or climbing a sheer wall.
- **Sneak** is about staying unseen and unheard, whether hiding in the shadows, slipping past a creature, or lurking just out of sight.
- **Shoot** represents accuracy and aim, from hurling a stone or throwing a dagger to shooting a gun or firing a bow.
- **Think** is used when careful observation or problem-solving is required, such as noticing small details, analyzing a situation, or repairing something broken.
- **Sway** is for influencing others, whether through charm, persuasion, manipulation, or intimidation.
- **Loot** covers scavenging, searching, and scrounging for supplies, whether picking through rubble for useful gear, ransacking an old pharmacy, or spotting that half-hidden cache others missed.

When creating a character, each of these Skills is assigned a die rating, which determines how effective the character is when relying on that Skill.

### Checks

When a character attempts something challenging or tries to avoid a Consequence, they make a Check to see how it unfolds.

The GM defines the risks, dangers, or obstacles, and establishes whether the character's Position is good, standard, bad, or dire.

The player then chooses a Skill that is most relevant to their approach and rolls the die that matches its rating. If another player character lends a hand, they also make a Check but share the same risks. Take the highest result and interpret the result:

- **On a 1-2**: The action fails, or the character suffers the Consequence in full.
- **On a 3-4**: The action succeeds with a reduced effect, or the character suffers a lesser Consequence.
- **On a 5+**: The action greatly succeeds, or the Consequence is fully avoided. The higher the result, the greater the effect.

After a Check, every participant reduces the current rating of the Skill they used by one step: d12 → d10 → d8 → d6 → d4. A Skill cannot step down below a d4.

> _Consequences are negative outcomes the GM introduces when things go wrong: injuries or Harm, lost or stressed Items, enemies appearing, Positions worsening, or the fiction shifting against the characters._

### Luck Checks

When needed, the GM may also test how lucky a character is. To do this, they assign a die (e.g. d4 or d6) based on how favorable the odds are for the character, roll it, and interpret the result as they would any other Check.

Alternatively, the GM may use one of the character's Skills as a basis for the roll: the Skill die is rolled but is not stepped down afterward.

- **On a 1-2**: Things go wrong for the character.
- **On a 3-4**: Things work out for the character, though not as well as hoped.
- **On a 5+**: Things work out very well for the character. The higher the result, the greater the effect.

### Position

When the fiction places a character at an advantage or disadvantage during a Check, the GM establishes the character's Position and adjusts how the roll is made.

- **Good Position**: The character is at an advantage. The player makes a Check with their Skill die stepped up.
- **Standard Position**: The character is neither advantaged nor disadvantaged. The player makes a Check with their Skill die.
- **Bad Position**: The character is at a disadvantage. The player makes a Check with their Skill die stepped down.

In some special cases, a Check may be skipped or be impossible to make:

- **Controlled Position**: The character has complete control. The player skips the Check and the action succeeds outright.
- **Desperate Position**: The character faces an overwhelming or impossible challenge. The player must change how their character approaches the situation.

> _A Skill at d12 cannot step up further. A Skill at d4 cannot step down further for Position purposes, but the Check can still be attempted. Furthermore, the GM does not need to set a Position for every single Check. This is a tool that prompts a conversation for when a roll feels uncertain or when the stakes of a scene need to be made clearer._

### Items

Items represent the weapons, gear, and other equipment a character carries. Each Item uses a die rating (d4-d12) which represents the Item's quality, durability, or quantity. A character can carry as many Items as makes sense in the fiction.

Every time a character uses an Item or when an Item suffers wear, they must roll a die that matches the Item's rating and interpret the result:

- **On a 1-2**: The Item's die rating steps down. If the Item was Stressed, or if its die rating falls below a d4, it is immediately depleted, worn out, or consumed.
- **On a 3-4**: The Item becomes Stressed, but the die rating stays unchanged.
- **On a 5+**: The Item's die rating stays unchanged.

A character may attempt to repair a depleted Item or restore a stepped down Item with a Check, given they have the tools or skills. They can also find replacements or refill consumables by scavenging.

Using an Item may improve a Check's Position, lessen the severity of a Consequence, or remove the need for a Check entirely depending on the situation.

### Loot Checks

When a character wants to scavenge a place for tools, weapons, medkits, or supplies, they make a Loot Check using their Loot Skill. A Loot Check can only happen in locations where it makes sense and if the fiction allows for it. The player rolls the die that matches their current Loot Skill rating and interprets the result.

- **On a 1-2**: The character finds nothing and a Consequence occurs.
- **On a 3-4**: The character finds an Item of lower quality or quantity (lower die rating).
- **On a 5+**: The character finds an Item. The higher the result, the better the find (higher die rating).

After a Loot Check, the Loot Skill steps down like any other Skill. A character may continue to use their Loot Skill when it is at d4, but at their own risk.

> _When a Consequence looms, the GM begins foreshadowing danger, dropping hints that something threatening is on the horizon. When a Consequence occurs, the story shifts sharply, forcing everyone to abandon their original plan and scramble for a plan B._

### Grit

When a player wants their character to give everything and attempt a feat of pure determination, they can use their Grit. A character's Grit is a single-use d12 that can be used in place of a Skill die during a Check.

### Harm

When a character faces a Consequence as a result of one of their actions, the GM can decide that they take some Harm. When a character takes Harm, the GM assigns 1-3 Harm based on severity. Minor injuries deal 1 Harm; serious wounds deal 2-3. If a character reaches 5 Harm, they become Vulnerable. When Vulnerable, failing a Check to avoid a Consequence could mean being taken out, or sudden death.

### Catch Their Breath

When a player chooses to Catch Their Breath, the character's Skills reset to their original ratings and their Grit is restored. This represents a moment to regain focus, and can happen at any time during play, even during moments of high tension, such as a combat encounter or a race against the clock.

If multiple characters Catch Their Breath at the same time, resolve it as a single group event. Afterward, the GM looks at the situation and introduces one Consequence for the group.

### Safe Rest

When a character locates a secure shelter and can rest for at least a day, they gain the same benefits as Catching Their Breath, without any of the Consequences.
They also clear an amount of Harm determined by the GM.

For example, a bandage or basic first aid may clear 1 Harm, a medkit or proper treatment clears 2 Harm, extended rest in a safe location with medical supplies clears 3 or more.

## Character Creation

To play the game, each player must create their own survivor. As the virus swept across the world and most were turned into the Breathless, those who remained lost something too: their memories.

At the start of the game, each character remembers only their name and the main occupation they had before the outbreak, and nothing else.

To create a survivor, each player first chooses their old occupation (see the Character pamphlet). Each occupation comes with pre-assigned Skills and Items, which the player notes on their character sheet. They then write down their character’s name and preferred pronouns.

Every occupation also includes a Memory track, representing the fog that clouds the character's past. Over the course of play, memories slowly return.

At the beginning of each new session, each player unlocks the next memory on their track. They make a Check with their Think Skill to determine how clearly the memory surfaces:

- **On a 1-2:** The memory comes in fragments. Blurred faces, muffled voices, details that slip away as quickly as they appear.
- **On a 3-4:** The memory surfaces but is blurred. Parts remain uncertain, but enough is clear to anchor it in the character's past.
- **On a 5+:** The memory returns in full. Names, stories, faces, people, places, everything is clear as water.

Once a memory is unlocked, its state is fixed; a fragmented or blurred memory will stay fragmented.

> _This phase of play is very much a conversation. A way for the GM to ask questions and for the player to try to refine who their character was and how it compares to who they are now. Other players may give suggestions but the concerned player is the one making the final call about their character._

# Journey and Haven Pamphlet

The characters are survivors of a world swallowed by a dangerous virus outbreak. Civilization collapsed under a brutal infection that turned people into Breathless, savage, and rabid living dead creatures. Those who remain have no memory of the life they once lived. Their past is hidden behind a fog, lifting only in small, broken pieces over time and trauma.

The Breathless do not crave flesh or blood. They hunger for the air the living breathe. Every exhale is a beacon to them. By day they prowl ruined streets and hollow buildings, hunting for prey. By night they drift into the woods, pressing against trunks, feeding from the trees themselves.

The game usually moves through three phases: Journey, Haven, and Survival. Each phase provides tools and rules to keep the table locked in grim, tense survival horror. Start play in one phase, then let the fiction and the players' choices push the story into the others as the narrative demands.

## The Journey

In a Journey, characters are traveling or trekking from one region to another over long distances. All travels are perilous in this world, so there will be dangers and threats along the way, but the alternative is usually not a pleasant one.

When starting the game, we recommend beginning on a Journey and thinking about why the characters are traveling. The GM can either decide for the group or talk it out with the table. Some examples could include:

**We lost everything**: Something happened where the characters were living. A rival faction may have taken over, or a swarm of Breathless could have swept through. They lost what they had and now need to move, figuring things out along the way.

**I know of a place**: They have heard rumors of somewhere with law and order, of people who say they are safe, or that there is a vaccine in the work. Maybe another country is untouched and reaching the sea is the only way out. Whether the rumors are true is irrelevant. The objective, real or not, gives hope. And hope is enough to keep going.

**We cannot stay here long**: Staying in one place too long invites theft, raids, and most certainly death. As survivors accumulate wealth or security, others will want to claim it for themselves. The nomadic life keeps people alert. They move, find shelters, scavenge, and move again.

Before taking on a Journey, the players use a map and decide where they are going and which points they will stop at. Every point on the map is connected by a path.

At the start of their Journey, the GM assigns a Journey Die to the group, from d4 up to d12, depending on how well equipped the characters are. Each time the players move from one point to another along a path, the GM rolls the Journey Die and interprets the result as follows:

- **On a 1-2:** The journey comes to a halt, for the path is blocked. The Journey Die steps down and the story zooms in on the problem until it is resolved. Usually this means entering a Survival phase until the path is cleared or a new route is found.
- **On a 3-4:** The journey continues, but the path is hazardous. The Journey Die steps down and every player must also step down one of their Skills. The GM may use this pause to show how the road wears the characters thin.
- **On a 5+:** The journey continues and the path is clear. The group makes steady progress without any major setback.

Once a Journey has begun, characters cannot take a Safe Rest until they reach their final destination, or by pausing their travels for a full week in a shelter that is safe and secure enough.

The GM may change the Journey Die rating during the trip as the fiction justifies it, stepping it up for helpful finds (spare fuel, a guide, good weather) or stepping it down for setbacks (ambush, storm, broken vehicle).

## The Survival

In Survival, the story zooms in and the tension rises. This is used when characters enter dangerous locations, scavenge for supplies, or come face-to-face with direct threats.

The focus here is on moment-to-moment decisions. The GM frames a scene, describes the dangers closing in, and asks the players what they do. Choices matter, most actions carry risk and rolls come fast.

Exploring a ruined hospital, looting an abandoned mall, sneaking through streets crawling with Breathless, or fighting for control of a safehouse; these are usually Survival scenes.

Survival ends when the group has escaped the threat, cleared the danger, or reached a moment where the fiction allows the story to breathe again. This might mean continuing the path on their Journey, or returning to the safety of their Haven.

## The Haven

In a Haven, the survivors can finally stop the endless grind of the road and start rebuilding connections with people, politics, even scraps of civilization. Keeping a Haven safe is never easy; one spark is enough to see the whole effort collapse. As such, survivors often need to leave the safe walls to hunt for supplies, bargain with nearby factions, and make sure the dead stay far from home.

A Haven can take many forms: an abandoned building, a fortified complex, a cluster of improvised shelters, or even a walled city. They usually offer some kind of advantage, otherwise it would not be worth defending. Access to clean water, a steady supply of food, or natural barriers are common reasons to settle.

While in a Haven, players can roleplay, barter, trade, and pursue personal goals. They can question the GM about rumors, investigate leads, and interact with NPCs.

If the group is not starting the game on a Journey, beginning in a Haven is also a good choice.

### Haven Dice

The Haven’s protection is tracked with three dice: the Containment Die, the Supplies Die, and the Morale Die. Each ranges from d4 to d12, set by the GM depending on the Haven’s state. When the survivors leave on a run or a scouting mission, all three are rolled.

**Containment Die**: Measures the state of the infection in the surrounding area. It tells the GM how many major Consequences tied to the Breathless they can use during the mission:

- **On a 1-2:** The GM can use up to three major Consequences.
- **On a 3-4:** The GM can use up to two major Consequences.
- **On a 5+:** The GM can use up to one major Consequence.

The GM may use a major Consequence at any moment to turn the fiction hard against the survivors, dragging the living dead into the spotlight.

**Supplies Die**: Measures hidden stockpiles and preparation. It tells the group how many times they can declare they “_came prepared”_, pulling a hidden stash, tool, or improvised gear into play. Each use grants a free d12-rated Item that a character can add to their backpack. These supplies are a shared resource for the whole group.

- **On a 1-2:** One prepped or stashed Item.
- **On a 3-4:** Two prepped or stashed Items.
- **On a 5+:** Three prepped or stashed Items.

**Morale Die**: Measures the will to endure of the group and their community. It sets the number of times the group can Catch Their Breath risk-free during a run. These uses let the survivors reset their Skills and Grit without triggering the usual Consequences.

- **On a 1-2:** One risk-free Catch Their Breath.
- **On a 3-4:** Two risk-free Catch Their Breath.
- **On a 5+:** Three risk-free Catch Their Breath.

Once all Haven Dice are rolled, the run or mission can begin and the game shifts into a Survival phase until the characters return to their Haven, if they can make it back.

### Aftermath of a Run

When a run ends, the GM works with the table to evaluate how it went by asking:

- Did the group achieve the run’s objective?
- Was there any collateral damage?
- Were any innocents harmed or killed?
- Was a character taken out or badly hurt?

Based on the discussion, the GM classifies the mission as one of the following:

**Haul:** The survivors pulled through the run mostly intact. The GM then increases the rating of one Haven Die, usually one tied to the run’s goal, by one or more steps.

**Cost:** The survivors got what they came for, but something had to break along the way. The GM then increases the rating of one Haven Die, usually one tied to the run’s goal, by one step. At the same time, they must decrease another Haven Die by one step, usually tied to the price that was paid.

**Loss:** The survivors came back empty-handed, or worse. The GM decreases the rating of one Haven Die, usually one tied to the run’s goal, by one step.

If at any time two or more Haven Dice are reduced to a d4, the GM triggers a **Fallout**.

### Fallout

The Haven has Fallen. Morale collapses, supplies run dry, and the contagion surges. The situation escalates to new extremes, leaving the survivors with no choice but to flee their homes.

When Fallout begins, the GM declares a new reality for the characters and the game shifts into a Survival phase. If the survivors can escape alive, they must begin a new Journey; taking it one day at a time or seeking a new Haven.

Fallout may also mark the end of the game, or serve as a turning point where time jumps forward and the players either continue with the same characters or create new ones to carry on with the story.
