Writing Guidelines

- Write in third person only when describing rules. Use the character, the player, or themselves. Never use you, your, or yourself except in guidelines, examples, notes, etc.
- Use "1DX" when instructing to roll (e.g., "roll 1D6"). Use just "DX" when referring to a rating or die type (e.g., "D6 damage").
- Format Conditions as gain a "name" Condition.

## What Is This

Freeblade is an old school fantasy adventure roleplaying game about wanderers in a world of magic, ruins, monsters, and forgotten places. Players take the role of free swords, bound to no lord or guild, carving their own path through a land filled with mystery and danger.

This game is a generic version of the ruleset originally designed for Nightsong. It is intended for classic fantasy play or as a system reference document to serve as a foundation for original published work.

## How To Play

The goal of this game is to explore a fictional world and see an emergent story unfold over time.

One player takes the role of the Referee, the neutral voice of the world, who describes a believable setting, presents problems and opportunities, and decides when rules should be used and how they should be interpreted.

The other players each control a character, interpreting what they see and feel, and deciding how they act.

The game revolves around a conversation: the Referee describes a scene, players ask questions and declare actions, outcomes are resolved through fiction or rules, the world changes, and the conversation resumes.

## Dice

This game uses polyhedral dice. They are written as D followed by a number indicating which die to roll. D4 is a four sided die, D6 is a six sided die, and so on. A number before the D means roll multiple dice and add the results together. 2D6 means roll two six sided dice and sum the results.

Other notations include:

- D2: Roll a D6. Results of 1 to 3 count as 1, and 4 to 6 count as 2.
- D3: Roll a D6. Results of 1 to 2 count as 1, 3 to 4 count as 2, and 5 to 6 count as 3.
- D66: Roll a D6 twice. The first roll is the tens digit and the second is the ones digit. Results range from 11 to 66, for a total of 36 possible outcomes.

## Play Materials

Each player needs a character sheet, a set of polyhedral dice, and a pencil with an eraser. The Referee also needs a digital or printed copy of this book.

## Rulings

This game includes a resilient, hackable set of rules, but they will not cover every scenario you encounter. You are expected to bend, break, and rebuild them to suit your table. This game is yours; consider this our permission to do whatever you want with it.

## Play Ethos

The world is dangerous. Characters survive through clever play and unfair fights. Play to find out what happens, and remember the world is indifferent to their desires. Survival and legacy are earned through smart action.

## Characters

To create a character, go through the following steps.

### 1. Abilities

A character has four core Abilities that define their capabilities in different situations.

Strength represents might and power. This Ability also determines the number of Slots a character has for carrying items and bearing conditions.

Dexterity represents agility and finesse. This Ability also determines Focus, a per-session reserve that can be spent to reroll dice, give an attack Advantage, or impose Disadvantage on an incoming attack.

Presence represents willpower and charm. This Ability is used to resist the strain of casting Spells and determines how many Spell books a character can refill during a Long Rest.

Constitution represents toughness and resistance. This Ability determines starting Hit Points, a measure of the number of injuries a character can sustain before they die, and is used to resist fatigue, poison, and disease.

Distribute +2, +1, 0, and -1 on the Abilities, or roll 2D6 for each using the list below. If no score is +1 or higher, reroll all Abilities.

- On a 2, set the Ability score to -3.
- On a 3, set the Ability score to -2.
- On a 4 to 5, set the Ability score to -1.
- On a 6 to 8, set the Ability score to 0.
- On a 9 to 10, set the Ability score to +1.
- On an 11, set the Ability score to +2.
- On a 12, set the Ability score to +3.

### 2. Hit Points

Hit Points represent the number of injuries a character can sustain before they die. Set the character maximum Hit Points to Constitution + 6.

### 3. Focus

Focus is a per-session reserve that can be spent to reroll dice, give an attack Advantage, or impose Disadvantage on an incoming attack.

Each session, a character Focus is set to the character Dexterity score, up to 3.

Unspent Focus is lost at the end of each session and does not carry over.

### 4. Slots

Slots measure how much a character can carry and how many conditions they can bear. Set the character total Slots to Strength + 10.

### 5. Starting Belongings

Characters start the game with a number of items. Standard items take 1 Slot, bulky items take 2 Slots, and petty items take no Slots.

Identify the character highest Ability score. If there is a tie, choose the Ability. Then roll 1D6 on the matching table below to determine the starting character belongings.

### 6. Additional Details

Lastly, roll or choose on the Details tables available on the next page to flesh out the character more. Note down the character name and preferred pronouns. The character can now start their journey!

## Core Rules

### Abilities

- Strength: might and power.
- Dexterity: finesse and agility.
- Presence: willpower and charm.
- Constitution: toughness and resistance.

Distribute +2, +1, 0, and -1 on the Abilities, or roll 2D6 for each using the list below. If no score is +1 or higher, reroll all Abilities.

- On a 2, set the Ability score to -3.
- On a 3, set the Ability score to -2.
- On a 4 to 5, set the Ability score to -1.
- On a 6 to 8, set the Ability score to 0.
- On a 9 to 10, set the Ability score to +1.
- On an 11, set the Ability score to +2.
- On a 12, set the Ability score to +3.

### Hit Points

A character maximum Hit Points (HP) begins at Constitution + 6 and represents the number of injuries the character can sustain before they die. Damage reduces HP. At 0 HP or lower, the character will die in a number of minutes, or Rounds, equal to Constitution + 1D4 unless helped.

### Rests

- A Short Rest (10 minutes) refills 1D4 HP.
- A Long Rest (6 hours) refills 1D6 HP.
- A Full Rest (1 week) refills all HP.

### Focus

Each session, a character has Focus equal to their Dexterity score, up to 3. Focus is spent to reroll, give an attack Advantage (1D12 Damage), or impose Disadvantage on an incoming attack (1D4 Damage). Unspent Focus is lost at session end.

### Step Dice

Step Dice help abstract time or dwindling resources. They range from D12 to D0 and step down along D12, D10, D8, D6, D4, and D0. At D0, the fiction changes or the resource is depleted. They resolve like:

- On a 1, step down the die twice.
- On a 2 to 3, step down the die once.
- On a 4+, the die stays unchanged.

### Slots

A character has Strength + 10 Slots for carrying items and equipment.

Items: Most items take 1 Slot. Bulky items take 2, and petty items take none. Supplies such as torches or rations have limited uses, which are tracked with a Step Die that is rolled when the item is used. At D0, the item is depleted.

Weapons and Armor: Weapons (D4 to D12) deal Damage, while Armor (D4 to D6) reduces it. Shields (D4 to D6) can block one attack completely. All equipment dice also serve as Step Dice. Roll Weapons and Armor after each combat encounter, but Shields are rolled after each use.

Conditions: A character can suffer Conditions such as fatigue, stress, broken limbs, poison, and more. Each Condition takes 1 Slot, but may take more if it worsens over time. If no Slot is available, the character must drop something to make room. Conditions hinder characters and may impose Disadvantage on certain actions, or render them impossible. Conditions must be cleared through actions in the fiction such as resting, receiving care, and more.

### Checks

When a character faces a difficult challenge or tries to avoid a dangerous consequence, make a Check. Roll 1D20 and add a relevant Ability score. If the total meets or exceeds the Difficulty Rating (DR), their action succeeds.

- A DR of 6 to 9 is routine or easy.
- A DR of 12 is normal.
- A DR of 15 to 18 is difficult or extreme.

Advantages: For each Advantage in the fiction, roll 1D6, and add the highest to the total. For each Disadvantage, roll 1D6, and subtract the highest from the total. These cancel each other on a one to one basis.

Criticals: A natural 20 is always a success, and a natural 1 is always a failure.

### Spells

Spells live in books or scrolls and have limited uses tracked with a Step Die. Books take 1 Slot, while scrolls take none. Anyone can use magic, and Spells always take effect when used, but the caster must make a DR12 Presence Check or gain a "fatigued" Condition. After each cast, roll the Spell's Step Die. At D0, the Spell is drained. A character may refill a number of Spell books equal to their Presence score per Long Rest. Drained scrolls cannot be refilled.

### Advancements

The Referee decides when characters get an advancement. When it happens, each adds 1D6 to their maximum HP. Then, roll 1D6 for each Ability. If the result is equal to or higher than the Ability current score, increase it by 1, up to a limit of +6.

### Combat

Initiative: At the start of each Round, all roll 1D6 for initiative and act in order from the highest to lowest. NPCs act first on ties. Those caught off guard act last. Players may swap their die if they have not acted yet. Per Round, each can move a short distance and take one other action.

NPCs: NPCs are made of HP, Weapons, and Armor. At 0 HP, they are taken out.

Attacks: The attacker rolls their Weapon Die for Damage. If the defender has armor, roll their Armor Die. Subtract Armor from Damage and apply the remainder to the defender HP.

Advantages: Attacks with Advantage deal 1D12 Damage, regardless of the weapon used. Unarmed attacks or ones with Disadvantage always deal 1D4. If an attack Damage is unclear, the Referee assigns an appropriate value as needed.

Misses: When a Weapon Die rolls a 1, the attack misses. When an Armor Die rolls a 1, the armor is ignored.

Wear and Tear: When a fight ends, roll the Step Die of all Weapons and Armor used and step down as normal. At D0, the items break and must be repaired or replaced through actions in the fiction.

### Die of Fate

When an outcome is uncertain, the Referee may roll a 1D6 Die of Fate. On a 1 to 3, the answer is negative, and on a 4 to 6, it is positive. The Referee may adjust the odds by assigning different X in 6 chances to the result depending on the situation.

## Procedures

### Basics

The following procedures use three different scales of time:

- Rounds: Used during combat. Each Round lasts less than 1 minute.
- Turns: Used during exploration. Each Turn is around 10 minutes.
- Watches: Used during travel. Each Watch is around 6 hours and a day is divided into four Watches: morning, afternoon, evening, and night.

### Journeying

When characters journey into the wilds, use these procedures.

Travel: Characters can travel six miles per Watch on clear terrain. Difficult terrain halves this distance. Clear paths double it.

Weather: At the start of each Watch, roll the Die of Fate to determine if the weather is kind. If not, the group can wait it out, making no progress on their journey, or press on with Disadvantage and half travel distance. The Referee may adjust the odds based on season and climate.

Navigation: When traveling without a clear path or landmark, roll the Die of Fate to determine if the characters can find their way. If not, they get lost and make no progress on their journey. The Referee may adjust the odds based on the weather and on how clear the path is.

Foraging: When foraging or hunting, roll the Die of Fate to determine if the characters find anything worthwhile. If so, increase a ration Step Die by a number of steps. The Referee may adjust the odds based on terrain and season.

Rations: Each character must consume one ration per day, rolling its Step Die, or gain a "starving" Condition.

Long Rest: Characters may spend one Watch (6 hours) taking a Long Rest to recover. If they do not do this at least once a day, they gain a "fatigued" Condition.

### Delving

When characters explore dark reaches, use these procedures.

Exploration: Each Turn, characters may move to a nearby area and take one additional action.

Light: A reliable light source is required while delving. Without one, characters have Disadvantage on all their actions and attacks. A single light source is usually often for a group moving together. When igniting a new light, the player rolls the Step Die of the matching item. To track how long the light lasts, the Referee uses a duration Step Die: D4 for torches, and D6 for lanterns. Every 20 minutes of real time, the Referee rolls that die and steps it down as normal. At D0, the light goes out and a new one must be lit.

Short Rest: Characters may spend one Turn (10 minutes) taking a Short Rest to recover. Resting may waste time or attract danger.

### Encounters and Events

When characters travel the wilds or delve into the depths, the Referee rolls 1D6 at the start of each Turn or Watch.

- On a 1, a random encounter occurs.
- On a 2, signs or omens appear. The Referee starts a D6 Step Die and rolls it at the start of each following Turn or Watch. At D0, an encounter occurs.
- On a 3, the environment shifts (terrain worsens, structure strains, weather changes) in a meaningful way.
- On a 4, something essential, light, spell, item, resource, or mount, falters.
- On a 5, exhaustion sets in. All must take a Short Rest or take 1D4 Damage.
- On a 6, there is a moment of calm.

Distance: When an encounter occurs, it is 2D6 x 10 feet away. Dense terrain or darkness halves this distance, while open ground or advance warning doubles it.

Reactions: To determine an NPC initial reaction to the characters, roll 2D6:

- On a 2 to 3, they are hostile.
- On a 4 to 5, they are wary.
- On a 6 to 8, they are curious.
- On a 9 to 10, they are kind.
- On an 11 to 12, they are helpful.

Off Guard: If an NPC is unaware, roll the Die of Fate to see if they are caught off guard. If so, they act last on the initiative in the case it triggers a combat.

Morale: If a group of NPCs loses half their numbers or a lone NPC loses half their HP, roll the Die of Fate to see if they break. If so, they attempt to flee or yield.

## NPCs and Creatures

When encountering NPCs or creatures, use these procedures.

Drive: Most NPCs have drives or goals. They may accept bribes, withdraw when outmatched, or negotiate if it serves them. Violence is rarely the only option.

Hit Points: Most NPCs and creatures have 4 to 12 HP. Tough or large beings have 13 to 20 HP. Only colossal threats exceed 20 HP, up to a maximum of 30 HP.

Damage: Unarmed or weak attacks deal D4 Damage. Light weapons or attacks deal D6 Damage. Standard weapons or dangerous attacks deal D8 Damage. Heavy weapons or deadly threats deal D10 Damage.

Armor: Most NPCs and creatures have no armor. Some have D4 armor, while hardier foes have D6. Unusual beings may grant attackers Advantage, impose Disadvantage on certain attacks, or prove immune to them entirely.

Specials: Certain NPCs or creatures may use attacks that are exceptions to normal rules. These special attacks could ignore standard Weapon Dice, bypass armor entirely, inflict Conditions, or impose unusual effects.

Colossal Creatures: Giant beings cannot be harmed without targeting weak points or exploiting the environment. All must work together to identify these vulnerabilities in the hope of bringing them down or escaping them.
