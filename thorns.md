**Steel and Salt**

A penitent walks into the Derweald to keep their vows. The forest takes them back, piece by piece.

## The Derweald

The Derweald is a living rot, ancient and hungry. Its roots drink names, memories, and blood. What dies in its shadow rises again, bark-bound and driven by the forest's will.

Some hunters survive their claiming and keep their will. They cut root scars into their forearms with blessed steel and pack the wounds with salt until they rise into knotted patterns. These scars are proof that both body and soul are battlegrounds.

The Order of the Duskwatch accepts these penitent hunters as Wardens and sends them back into the thorns to complete their Vows.

## What Is Needed

One standard deck of cards shared among the table, paper, and pencil. One Referee and one to four players.

Card values follow this scale: Aces count as 1, numbered cards use their normal value, and face cards are valued at 11 for Jacks, 12 for Queens, and 13 for Kings.

After a card is used, it is put in a discard pile. When the deck runs empty and cards are needed, the Referee shuffles the discard pile to form a new deck.

## Making a Character

Players take a piece of paper (this will act as their character sheet) and then go through the following steps:

### 1. Name

Each player writes their own name on their character sheet.

### 2. Character Name

The player chooses a name for their character.

### 3. Abilities

Ability scores measure a character's core capabilities. Each Ability ranges from 0 to 3 and determines how many cards the player draws during Tests. The player distributes 6 points among four Abilities, with no single Ability exceeding 3:

- **Iron**: Strength and endurance. Governs brute force, resilience, heavy blows, and physical labor.
- **Edge**: Agility and precision. Governs quick reflexes, acrobatics, stealth, and aimed strikes.
- **Wits**: Cunning and perception. Governs awareness, deduction, traps, and tactical thinking.
- **Heart**: Willpower and connection. Governs resolve, persuasion, animal handling, and resisting corruption.

### 4. Details

Details record important facts about a character or track the gear they carry. There is no limit to how many Details a character can have. A character can carry as much gear as makes sense in the fiction, but the Referee has the final say. Relevant Details can help or hinder a character when tackling difficult challenges or when trying to avoid a direct threat.

During character creation, the player writes one Detail from each category:

- **Weapon**: 1. Sword, 2. Axe, 3. Spear, 4. Bow, 5. Flail, 6. Dagger, 7. Mace, 8. Greatsword, 9. Crossbow, 10. Halberd, Jack. Warhammer, Queen. Quarterstaff, King. Whip
- **Armor**: 1–3. Cloak or Clothes, 4–6. Leather, 7–9. Chain, 10–11. Plate, 12–13. Shield
- **Tools**: 1. Lantern, 2. Rope, 3. Crowbar, 4. Lockpicks, 5. Chain, 6. Grapnel, 7. Torch, 8. Vials, 9. Compass, 10. Spikes, Jack. Mirror, Queen. Chalk, King. Trap Kit
- **Skill**: 1. Herbalist, 2. Blademaster, 3. Marksman, 4. Ritualist, 5. Beast Tamer, 6. Duelist, 7. Scout, 8. Magehunter, 9. Pathfinder, 10. Skirmisher, Jack. Shadowblade, Queen. Deathseeker, King. Spellbreaker

### 5. Gift

A Gift is power stolen from the Derweald and held by rite and restraint. Each character has one, recorded as a Detail. Each time a character invokes their Gift, the Pull of corruption grows stronger. The player chooses one:

- **Stonehide**: Flesh hardens like stone, making it extremely hard to be wounded.
- **Bonegrind**: Channel brutal force, gaining unnatural strength.
- **Vinewright**: Control the roots and thorns to entangle, snare, pierce, or drag.
- **Wildtongue**: Command the warped creatures of the forest to do your bidding.
- **Soulgrip**: Seize hold of another's emotions and bend them to your will.

### 6. Harm and Pull

Harm tracks physical damage. When all five boxes are filled, the character falls unconscious, is critically wounded, or is slain. The player marks five empty Harm boxes.

Pull measures how tightly the Derweald grips the character's soul. At Pull 6, the forest claims them for good. The player sets Pull to 1.

## Tests

When a character attempts something risky, difficult, or when they try to avoid a direct threat, the Referee calls for a Test. First, the Referee frames what's at stake. What happens on failure, what consequences are on the table. Then the Referee sets a Difficulty Rating (DR).

### Difficulty Rating

The DR represents how hard something is to accomplish. The Referee chooses based on the obstacle:

- **Routine (DR 3)**: Simple, but has a chance of failure.
- **Simple (DR 5)**: Manageable with some skill or luck.
- **Standard (DR 7)**: A meaningful challenge.
- **Difficult (DR 9)**: Only the capable or fortunate prevail.
- **Extreme (DR 11)**: At the edge of mortal limits.

### Making the Test

The Referee determines which Ability applies. The player draws cards equal to the relevant Ability's value. If the Ability is 0, the player draws 2 cards and discards the highest. Relevant Details (the right or wrong item, the use of a Gift, etc.) may increase or reduce the DR.

The player reveals all drawn cards and counts how many meet or exceed the DR:

- **2+ cards meet or exceed the DR**: It's a critical success. The character succeeds decisively: the outcome is better than expected, faster, cleaner, or carries an additional advantage.
- **1 card meets or exceeds the DR**: It's a success. The character accomplishes what they set out to do.
- **0 cards meet or exceed the DR**: It's a failure. The character fails or faces the stated consequences.

## Harm

Harm tracks how much punishment a character can take before things become critical or mortal. A character starts with five empty Harm boxes.

When a character takes damage, the Referee draws cards based on the threat (1 card for standard threats, 2 for serious threats, 3 for dire threats), and each black card (Spades or Clubs) fills one Harm box while red cards (Hearts or Diamonds) are painful near-misses that don't fill boxes.

When all five boxes are filled, the character falls unconscious, is critically wounded, or is slain. The Referee and player determine which fits the moment.

### Rest and Recovery

Recovery requires time and safety.

- **Short Rest** (minutes of catching breath): The player draws 1 card.
- **Long Rest** (hours of shelter and bandages): The player draws 2 cards.
- **Full Rest** (days in true sanctuary): The player draws 3 cards.

Each red card clears 1 Harm box.

## Pull

A character's Pull level represents the Derweald's hold over their corrupted soul, a creeping tether that tightens with every dark bargain. It begins at 1 and climbs toward 6. When Pull reaches 6, the forest claims the character forever: they are removed from play, fall under the Referee's control, and become a threat to those they once called allies.

### Invoking a Gift

A character can invoke their Gift to solve problems or overcome obstacles. Using a Gift may cancel the need for a Test entirely, or significantly reduce the DR of a Test. Anytime a character invokes their Gift, they must make a Pull Check.

**Pull Check**: The player draws 1 card and compares its value to their current Pull level. If the card's value is less than or equal to their Pull level, it increases by 1.

### Purification

A character can resist the forest's claim in moments of sanctity. This requires a place of holiness: a shrine, altar, sacred grove, or sanctuary blessed by the Church. The character confesses sins at a relic, holds a vigil while fasting, prays over running water, or pours blood into salt.

After the rite, the player draws 1 card. If the drawn card is red, the character's Pull level is reduced by 1.

## Getting Started

### Choose a Group Vow

A Vow is a mission, the purpose that keeps the Order's mercy pointed forward. When the group completes a Vow, each character reduces Pull by 1 and the group takes on a new Vow. The group chooses one:

- Deliver these ashes to their destination
- Find revenge for a death that won't stay buried
- Rescue family before the roots claim them
- Return a stolen relic to its sanctified altar
