# Breathless

# Survival Pamphlet

Everyone got infected. Not one soul escaped that fate. The first sign of infection was memory loss. One moment you knew your name, the next you were staring at strangers with no idea who they were, what year it was, or who you had ever been.

That was the best outcome. For the unlucky ones, it went a step further. Their skin drained pale, their eyes glazed, and every breath came in ragged, furious gasps. They became the Breathless: living dead creatures which tore cities apart and left the world in ruins in mere weeks.

Today, they roam the streets and wilds, hunting the living to eat off their flesh and suck in their last breath, literally.

A single bite from a Breathless wakes the sickness sleeping inside you, and soon you are one of them, swept into their endless swarms.

Now, all that remains is to loot, shoot, and survive.

## Basics

### Content Warning

This game touches on many sensitive subjects such as \[…\]. At the end of the day, this game belongs to the table to do whatever they want with. If the group wants certain topics to be removed or included from the game, they should do it. The table should work together to decide what lines should not be crossed and what subjects should be avoided during play. Some topics can be part of the world without needing to be shown "on screen." It is also normal to forget some things during those first talks, and that is OK. If something uncomfortable comes up in play, pause the game and talk about whether it should be cut out of the story or just hidden behind a veil. Once everyone agrees and feels good about the new direction, the group can rewind the story a bit and pick up play again.

### Game Material

To play this game, each player needs a copy of this pamphlet, a full set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12), plus pencils and erasers.

### This Game

This game is a tabletop role-playing game where people come together to collaboratively create a story within a fictional world, using the game’s rules to bring tension, uncertainty, and drama.

There are two types of personas at the table. First are the players, each controlling a character within the narrative. Then there is the game moderator (or GM), whose role is to depict the world, portray non-player characters (or NPCs), guide conversations, and act as a referee when rules or rulings are needed.

A typical flow of play begins with the GM painting a scene, describing what the characters see, hear, smell, and feel. The GM then introduces problems or sources of tension, and waits for the players to decide what their characters will do about it. Players can ask questions about the scene, which the GM must answer honestly. They can also act out or narrate what their characters do. Depending on what the characters do, the GM may simply allow success if there is no real risk, but they could also call for the use of a certain mechanic or rule to determine the outcome.

### GM Guidelines

Guide the story, present challenges to the group. Be a fan of the players. Ask them questions, fill the world with their answers. If it is cool, let them try or split complex challenges into multiple Checks.

### Player Guidelines

Players narrate what their characters do. They make Checks when things are risky. Give everyone a time to shine. Fill the world with ideas. Take risks, and rise up from failures.

## Rules

### Skills

During play, players rely on six core Skills of their characters to face challenges.

- **Bash** is all about strength and force, whether breaking down a door, pushing through an obstacle, or using raw power to wreck something in the way.
- **Dash** comes into play whenever speed and agility are needed, like sprinting across rooftops, leaping over gaps, or climbing a sheer wall.
- **Sneak** is about staying unseen and unheard, whether hiding in the shadows, slipping past a creature, or lurking just out of sight.
- **Shoot** represents accuracy and aim, from hurling a stone or throwing a dagger to shooting a gun or firing a bow.
- **Think** is used when careful observation or problem-solving is required, such as noticing small details, analyzing a situation, or repairing something broken.
- **Sway** is for influencing others, whether through charm, persuasion, manipulation, or intimidation.

When creating a character, each of these Skills is assigned a die rating (d4, d6, etc.), which determines how effective the character is when relying on that Skill.

### Checks

When a player attempts something challenging, they make a Check to see how it unfolds. A roll is only required if the action carries risk. The GM describes the danger, establishes the character’s Position, and clarifies whether the action is possible, needs extra steps or is outright impossible.

If the action can be attempted, the player chooses a Skill or Item and rolls the die that matches its rating. If another player character lends a hand, they also roll a Check, but share the same risks. Take the die that shows the highest number and interpret the result:

- **On a 1-2**: The action fails.
- **On a 3-4**: The action barely succeeds.
- **On a 5+**: The action greatly succeeds. The higher the result, the greater the effect.

Survival in this world takes its toll. After a Check, every participant reduces the rating of the Skill or Item they used by one step: d12 → d10 → d8 → d6 → d4. A Skill cannot step down below a d4. When an Item falls below a d4, it is depleted; it breaks, is lost, becomes worn out, or fades from the fiction unless it is made relevant again.

_\> When needed, the GM may also test how lucky a character is. To do this, they assign a die based on the odds of the event occurring, roll it, and interpret the result as they would any other Check._

### Position

When the fiction places a character at an advantage or disadvantage during a Check, the GM establishes the character's Position and adjusts how the roll is made.

- **Excellent Position**: The fiction strongly favors the character. The player rolls twice and keeps the highest result.
- **Great Position**: The character is in control of the situation. The player rolls a die one step higher than planned. Afterward, they step down the die they were originally meant to roll, not the stepped up one.
- **Fair Position**: The character is neither advantaged nor disadvantaged. The player makes a normal Check.
- **Bad Position**: The fiction works against the character. The player rolls twice and keeps the lowest result.
- **Dire Position**: The challenge is overwhelming. The character cannot proceed with the action as planned. They must try a different approach or shift the fiction before attempting again.

_\> The GM does not need to set a Position for every single Check. This is a tool for when a roll feels uncertain or when the stakes of a scene need to be made clearer._

### Loot Checks

When a player wants to scavenge a place for tools, weapons, medkits, or supplies, they make a Loot Check (as long as the fiction supports it). The group begins with a d12 Loot Die, which steps down after each use. When looting, players roll their current Loot Die and interpret the result. They may continue to use the Loot Die when it is a d4, but at their own risk.

- **On a 1-2**: trouble is here...
- **On a 3-4**: there is trouble ahead...
- **On a 5-6**: add a d6 **Item**.
- **On a 7-8**: add a d8 **Item**.
- **On a 9-10**: add a d10 **Item**.
- **On a 11-12**: add a d12 **Item**.

_\> When trouble is ahead, the GM begins foreshadowing danger, dropping hints that something threatening is on the horizon. When trouble is here, the story shifts sharply, forcing everyone to abandon their original plan and scramble for a plan B._

### Grit

When a player wants their character to give everything and attempt a feat of pure determination, they can use their Grit. A character’s Grit is single-use d12 that can be used in place of a Skill or Item die during a Check.

### Backpack

When a player succeeds on a Loot Check, any Items found are added to their character’s backpack. Items can be used in place of Skills when making Checks, and each Item has a die rating that steps down after every use. When an Item falls below a d4, it is depleted; it breaks, is lost, becomes worn out, or fades from the fiction until it is made relevant again. What we mean by fading away is that it isn’t necessarily gone in the fiction. Instead, the story simply stops focusing on it, shifting the spotlight to the character’s Skills and other Items moving forward.

_\> Using an Item over a Skill during a Check may put a character in a different Position in the fiction._

### Stress

When a character faces a consequence as a result of one of their actions, the GM can decide that they take some Stress. If a character reaches 4 Stress, they become Vulnerable. When Vulnerable, failing a dangerous action could mean being taken out, or sudden death.

### Catch Their Breath

To reset a character's Skills and Loot Die back to their original ratings as well as restore the character's Grit, a player can choose to Catch Their Breath. This represents a brief break in tension, a moment to regain focus, and can happen at any time during play (even in the middle of combat). After a character catches their breath, the GM looks at the situation and introduces a new complication for the group.

### Safe Rest

When a character locates a secure shelter and can rest for at least a week, they gain the same benefits as Catching Their Breath, without any of the complications. They also clear an amount of Stress determined by the GM (the GM declares the exact amount based on the fiction).

## Character Creation

To play the game, each player must create their own survivor. As the virus swept across the world and most were turned into the Breathless, those who remained lost something too: their memories.

At the start of the game, each character remembers only their name and the main occupation they had before the outbreak, and nothing else.

To create a survivor, each player first chooses their old occupation (see the Character pamphlet). Each occupation comes with pre-assigned Skills and Items, which the player notes on their character sheet. They then write down their character’s name and preferred pronouns.

Every occupation also includes a **Memory** track, representing the fog that clouds the character’s past. Over the course of play, memories slowly return.

**_/8/ what about levels of memory ?_**

At the beginning of each new session, each player makes a Check with their Think Skill to see if they recall the next memory.

- **On a 1-2:** The GM reveals the next memory on the track, but it comes in fragments. Blurred faces, muffled voices, details that slip away as quickly as they appear.
- **On a 3-4:** The GM reveals the next memory, this time with more detail. Some parts remain uncertain, but enough detail surfaces to anchor it in the character’s past.
- **On a 5+:** The GM reveals the next memory in full. Names, stories, faces, people, places, everything is clear as water.

_\> This phase of play is very much a conversation. A way for the GM to ask questions and for the player to try to refine who their character was and how it compares to who they are now. Other players may give suggestions but the concerned player is the one making the final call about their character._

# Journey and Haven Pamphlet

The characters are survivors of a world swallowed by a dangerous virus outbreak. Civilization collapsed under a brutal infection that turned people into Breathless, savage, and rabid living dead creatures. Those who remain have no memory of the life they once lived. Their past is hidden behind a fog, lifting only in small, broken pieces over time and trauma.

The Breathless do not crave flesh or blood. They hunger for the air the living breathe. Every exhale is a beacon to them. By day they prowl ruined streets and hollow buildings, hunting for prey. By night they drift into the woods, pressing against trunks, feeding from the trees themselves.

The game usually moves through three phases: Journey, Haven, and Survival. Each phase provides tools and rules to keep the table locked in grim, tense survival horror. Start play in one phase, then let the fiction and the players' choices push the story into the others as the narrative demands.

## The Journey

In a Journey, characters are traveling or trekking from one region to another over long distances. All travels are perilous in this world, so there will be dangers and threats along the way, but the alternative is usually not a pleasant one.

When starting the game, we recommend beginning on a Journey and thinking about why the characters are traveling. The GM can either decide for the group or talk it out with the table. Some examples could include:

**We lost everything**: Something happened where the characters were living. A rival faction may have taken over, or a swarm of Breathless could have swept through. They lost what they had and now need to move, figuring things out along the way.

**I know of a place**: They’ve heard rumors of somewhere with law and order, of people who say they are safe, or that there is a vaccine in the work. Maybe another country is untouched and reaching the sea is the only way out. Whether the rumors are true is irrelevant. The objective, real or not, gives hope. And hope is enough to keep going.

**We can't stay here long**: Staying in one place too long invites theft, raids, and most certainly death. As survivors accumulate wealth or security, others will want to claim it for themselves. The nomadic life keeps people alert. They move, find shelters, scavenge, and move again.

Before taking on a Journey, the players use a map and decide where they are going and which points they will stop at. Every point on the map is connected by a path.

At the start of their Journey, the GM assigns a Journey Die to the group, from d4 up to d12, depending on how well equipped the characters are. Each time the players move from one point to another along a path, the GM rolls the Journey Die and interprets the result as follows:

- **On a 1-2**: The path forward is blocked. The rating of Journey Die is reduced by one step and the story zooms in on the problem or obstacle that the group is facing until it is resolved. Usually this means the game enters a Survival phase until the path is cleared or a new route is found.
- **On a 3-4**: The path is hazardous. The rating of Journey Die is reduced by one step and every player must also reduce the rating of one of their Skills by one step. The GM may use this pause to show how the road wears the characters thin, creating space for uneasy rest where exhaustion makes every word heavier.
- **On a 5+**: The path ahead is clear. The group makes steady progress, moving closer to their destination without any major setback.

Once a Journey has begun, characters cannot take a Safe Rest until they reach their final destination, or by pausing their travels for a full week in a shelter that is safe and secure enough.

The GM may change the Journey Die rating during the trip as the fiction justifies it, stepping it up for helpful finds (spare fuel, a guide, good weather) or stepping it down for setbacks (ambush, storm, broken vehicle).

## The Survival

In Survival, the story zooms in and the tension rises. This is used when characters enter dangerous locations, scavenge for supplies, or come face-to-face with direct threats.

The focus here is on moment-to-moment decisions. The GM frames a scene, describes the dangers closing in, and asks the players what they do. Choices matter, most actions carry risk and rolls come fast.

Exploring a ruined hospital, looting an abandoned mall, sneaking through streets crawling with Breathless, or fighting for control of a safehouse; these are usually Survival scenes.

Survival ends when the group has escaped the threat, cleared the danger, or reached a moment where the fiction allows the story to breathe again. This might mean continuing the path on their Journey, or returning to the safety of their Haven.

## The Haven

In a Haven, the survivors can finally stop the endless grind of the road and start rebuilding connections with people, politics, even scraps of civilization. Keeping a Haven safe is never easy; one spark is enough to see the whole effort collapse. As such, survivors often need to leave the safe walls to hunt for supplies, bargain with nearby factions, and make sure the dead stay far from home.

A Haven can take many forms: an abandoned building, a fortified complex, a cluster of improvised shelters, or even a walled city. They usually offer some kind of advantage, otherwise it wouldn’t be worth defending. Access to clean water, a steady supply of food, or natural barriers are common reasons to settle.

While in a Haven, players can roleplay, barter, trade, and pursue personal goals. They can question the GM about rumors, investigate leads, and interact with NPCs.

If the group isn’t starting the game on a Journey, beginning in a Haven is also a good choice.

### Haven Dice

The Haven’s protection is tracked with three dice: the Containment Die, the Supplies Die, and the Morale Die. Each ranges from d4 to d12, set by the GM depending on the Haven’s state. When the survivors leave on a run or a scouting mission, all three are rolled.

**Containment Die**: Measures the state of the infection in the surrounding area. It tells the GM how many major threats tied to the Breathless they can use during the mission:

- **On a 1-2**: The GM can use up to three major threats.
- **On a 3-4**: The GM can use up to two major threats.
- **On a 5+**: The GM can use up to one major threat.

The GM may use a major threat at any moment to turn the fiction hard against the survivors, dragging the living dead into the spotlight.

**Supplies Die**: Measures hidden stockpiles and preparation. It tells the group how many times they can declare they “_came prepared”_, pulling a hidden stash, tool, or improvised gear into play. Each use grants a free d12-rated Item that a character can add to their backpack. These supplies are a shared resource for the whole group.

- **On a 1-2**: One prepped or stashed Item.
- **On a 3-4**: Two prepped or stashed Items.
- **On a 5+**: Three prepped or stashed Items.

**Morale Die**: Measures the will to endure of the group and their community. It sets the number of times the group can Catch Their Breath risk-free during a run. These uses let the survivors reset their Skills, Loot Die and Grit without triggering the usual complications.

- **On a 1-2**: One risk-free Catch Their Breath.
- **On a 3-4**: Two risk-free Catch Their Breath.
- **On a 5+**: Three risk-free Catch Their Breath.

Once all Haven Dice are rolled, the run or mission can begin and the game shifts into a Survival phase until the characters return to their Haven, if they can make it back.

### Aftermath of a Run

When a run ends, the GM works with the table to evaluate how it went by asking:

- Did the group achieve the run’s objective?
- Was there any collateral damage?
- Were any innocents harmed or killed?
- Was a character taken out or badly hurt?

Based on the discussion, the GM classifies the mission as one of the following:

**Haul:** The survivors pulled through the run mostly intact. The GM then increases the rating of one Haven Die, usually one tied to the run’s goal, by one or more steps.

**Cost:** The survivors got what they came for, but something had to break along the way. The GM then increases the rating of one Haven Die, usually one tied to the run’s goal, by one step. At the same time, they must decrease another Haven Die by one step, usually tied to the price that was paid.

**Loss:** The survivors came back empty-handed, or worse. The GM decreases the rating of one Haven Die, usually one tied to the run’s goal, by one step.

If at any time two or more Haven Dice are reduced to a d4, the GM triggers a **Fallout**.

### Fallout

The Haven has Fallen. Morale collapses, supplies run dry, and the contagion surges. The situation escalates to new extremes, leaving the survivors with no choice but to flee their homes.

When Fallout begins, the GM declares a new reality for the characters and the game shifts into a Survival phase. If the survivors can escape alive, they must begin a new Journey; taking it one day at a time or seeking a new Haven.

Fallout may also mark the end of the game, or serve as a turning point where time jumps forward and the players either continue with the same characters or create new ones to carry on with the story.
